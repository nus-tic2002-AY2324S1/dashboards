In Week 4, we added support for tracking three types of tasks: ToDos, Events, and Deadlines. However, we are not required to remove the old way of adding ordinary tasks. Therefore, when the user's command is `blah`, we should create a task called `blah`.
In `Level-5` of Week 5, we are asked to handle such input as an exception. Does this mean we need to remove the old way of adding ordinary tasks?

Not a bug report but a small suggestion:

"IntelliJ"s are almost always spelled as "Intellij", and "GitHub"s are sometimes spelled as "Github". Since the occurrences of "SourceTree" have been changed to "Sourcetree" as compared to earlier versions of the course website, I think "IntelliJ" and "GitHub" should be in their correct capitalization as well.

"Intellij IDE" in [Week 1 Admin](https://nus-cs2113-ay2324s1.github.io/website/schedule/week1/admin.html#tool-intellij-ide) or in `website/admin/tools.md` should be "IntelliJ IDEA".

```
Hello,

You are receiving this email because a request to resend TEAMMATES links associated with the email address e1125438@u.nus.edu was made on [TEAMMATES](https://teammatesv4.appspot.com/).

Sorry, we could not find any links since no session in TEAMMATES is associated with this email address.

You can [try again](https://teammatesv4.appspot.com/web/front/help/session-links-recovery) with a different email address or contact your course instructor(s) to check whether this email address is the one used to enroll you in TEAMMATES.

Technical help regarding TEAMMATES: Email TEAMMATES support team at teammates@comp.nus.edu.sg.

Thus, I can't log into TEAMMATES and conduct the preliminary peer evaluation.
