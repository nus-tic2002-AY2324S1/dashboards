Also, I am not sure if we want to include this line as of now. Since the [product overview](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/website/schedule/week7/project.html#ppp-sections-to-include-2) can be shared among all team members, I think we can leave this out as of now and come back to edit this in the later iterations.

I don't think so, but since I am going to implement saving and loading of tasks from disk, it would make sense for me to be in charge of Storage.

Moreover, as I would be handling most of the deployment and formatting of the GitHub Pages site, it would make sense for me to be in charge of Documentation too.

Anyways, we can always revisit this later in the project, if needed.

This `if` block will prevent the HTML comment from being rendered for each Admonition block. 

Personally, I believe that rendering this HTML comment on the webpage is redundant (especially when we are going to use Admonition blocks extensively), and thus should be left in the source code instead.

Yes, we are already crediting him in `/docs/index.md`.

However, the [course's policy on reuse](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/website/schedule/week12/admin.html#policy-on-reuse) says that we need to mention such reuse of code snippets as a comment. Since HTML comments are always rendered, I wrapped them in a `if` block so Jekyll ignores them when rendering the site.

Nevertheless, I will add a short comment to explain the rationale of the `if` block.

>     1. Could you elaborate on the use cases we have for auto-deployment?

One use case I can think of is that we do not need to manually clone the repo and execute the `gradlew build` command on our end on every commit. Instead, we can download the prebuilt .jar file and run it immediately.


>     2. I notice that you're using https://github.com/marvinpinto/action-automatic-releases. Do we have any use cases for pre-release vs tagged releases? Perhaps we can just keep pre-release deployments.
>     3. I'm not too sure that CS2103T follows semantic versioning. In the worst case, inconsistent versioning practices may result in poor tracking by the dashboards or confusion among other users. Do we still want this CI given this risk?
>        3.1 For example, the [website](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/website/admin/tp-w8.html) seems to recommend versioning that don't align with typical semantic versioning conventions.

Good catch! I also saw that we will have to `git tag v1.2` in [week 9](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/website/admin/tp-w9.html#2-wrap-up-v1-2). This will cause the `tagged-release` CI to fail as it does not follow semver strictly.

For now, I think we can still keep the pre-release versions like you mentioned, and manually create releases for major milestones (v1.2, v1.3 etc). However, the .jar binary in the pre-release will be overwritten with each CI run.

I guess it makes it easier us to quickly get the latest build of our master branch.

Regarding the versioning, no version number is implemented, so it will not affect any version numbers and tracking by the CS2103T scripts.

You can see my experimentation here on a separate repo: https://github.com/NUSTutors/tp-test-ci

Yeah sure, we can leave it as it is for now, and update them when the respective features are implemented.

Thanks for looking into this. A few points of clarification:

1. Could you elaborate on the use cases we have for auto-deployment?
2. I notice that you're using https://github.com/marvinpinto/action-automatic-releases. Do we have any use cases for pre-release vs tagged releases? Perhaps we can just keep pre-release deployments.
3. I'm not too sure that CS2103T follows semantic versioning. In the worst case, inconsistent versioning practices may result in poor tracking by the dashboards or confusion among other users. Do we still want this CI given this risk?  
3.1 For example, the [website](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/website/admin/tp-w8.html) seems to recommend versioning that don't align with typical semantic versioning conventions.

> One use case I can think of is that we do not need to manually clone the repo and execute the `gradlew build` command on our end on every commit. Instead, we can download the prebuilt .jar file and run it immediately.

Do pre-release jar files serve any purpose? I'm not sure anyone will be using them. I'm okay with adding this change, as long as it doesn't mess up the dashboard tracking. Also, how does the initial versioning work, since no version number has been specified yet?

Hello, I know this is just a tutorial PR that won't be merged, but some points to note:

1. [Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) prefixes should all be in lower case. Also, I don't think `Update` is a valid prefix.
2. Your branch seems to be based on our tp/branch-UG-draft branch instead of master. Try rebasing to tp/master instead, otherwise you will be introducing the unwanted files prematurely (yes I know this is just for tutorial and won't be merged).

AB3 comes with a very robust tokeniser, so there is no need for me to bring in the token manager system from IP. As such, it's probably simpler for us to keep their flag format for now, instead of our custom one.

Eg `n/FULL_NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`. The exact formats for each argument that count as valid can be found in the source code. That regex in the draft was more of an idea, but again it turns out AB3 already comes with its own validation.

The docs should then include the features AB3 comes with as opposed to what we originally planned from scratch. Eg email, and the new notes feature.

If we do change things like the format later on, we can update the docs again then.

The delete command takes an index as a parameter, where the index is based on what's currently displayed in the contacts panel. It cannot recognise by name.

It is worth noting that `clear` immediately deletes all contact data without confirmation. There may be a bit of ambiguity, if the user thinks it only clears the list of displayed contacts (the contacts panel).

Just as an aside, I wrote the eg in brackets for my section as I was bringing attention to just a subset of that role's responsibilities. I may not assist with every aspect related to a role, but the main person in charge of that role should probably touch on every aspect. Ie it may be fine to just mention the role without elaboration (since we are using the roles they defined for us), or list every responsibility of the role (eg add versioning to the integration role).

I considered looking at Netlify for previewing website changes in PRs, but given [the ominous warning](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/netlify.html), I decided against it.

> Caution: Netlify allows only 300 free build minutes per month. They use an unsavory practice of letting you exceed the limit silently and then sending you an invoice for the extra use. You will not be able to use Netlify again unless you pay (or get them to cancel the charge). Therefore, we caution you to use Netlify (if at all) during times you update documentation and only if you want to use Netlify Deploy Previews to help review such PRs.

You were right, merging the other AboutUs caused merge conflicts here.

Rough steps to resolve:

1. Check out your individual fork's PR branch
2. Pull from the team remote repo, so you have the latest master
3. Merge master into your PR branch
4. Resolve merge conflicts in your IDE and create the merge commit when ready
5. Push those commits to your individual fork
6. New commits should be reflected here and GitHub should recalculate ability to merge

Following the standard of other commands in the UG, I think it is better to change this:

- `Assign Employee to Project:` -&gt; `Assign employee(s) to a project`

There are other instances where this occurs, and it is best to change them (namely in line 150 and 174).

One minor suggestion here is that by indenting the asterisk forward, the list is no longer nested in the number list (initially from 1 to 6), and now the last point (i.e., Refer to the [Features]...) is renumbered from 6 to 1. 
So I think perhaps it's better to keep the indentation as it was in the original version?

Would using the index as a reference (just like how AB3 has done it), like `delete INDEX` instead of using the name (as multiple musicians may have the same name) more appropriate? Same applies to `tag instrument` and `tag genre`.

so cute the ice cream looks so good, Delicious vanilla ice cream, with its rich and velvety texture, is a timeless indulgence that tantalizes the taste buds and brings joy to people of all ages. Its allure lies in the simplicity of its ingredients, where the pure essence of vanilla transforms a humble mixture of cream, sugar, and eggs into a heavenly dessert.

The journey of savoring vanilla ice cream begins with the enticing aroma that wafts through the air as it is being prepared. The vanilla beans, sourced from exotic locales, infuse the creamy base with their intoxicating fragrance, promising a delightful experience. With each spoonful, one encounters a symphony of flavors, ranging from the initial sweet and creamy notes to the deeper, more complex undertones of the vanilla bean. The taste is a harmonious balance between sweetness and the subtle bitterness of the vanilla, creating a perfect blend that leaves a lingering, pleasant aftertaste.

Beyond its taste, vanilla ice cream is incredibly versatile. It serves as a blank canvas, complementing an array of desserts and toppings. Whether paired with warm, gooey chocolate brownies, fresh berries, or drizzled with caramel sauce, vanilla ice cream enhances the overall experience, adding a luxurious touch to any dessert table.

Moreover, the texture of well-made vanilla ice cream is an art form in itself. Creamy and smooth, it melts in the mouth, offering a momentary escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Each spoonful provides a sensation of cooling comfort, making it a popular choice on warm summer days and a comforting treat during colder seasons.

In essence, vanilla ice cream is more than just a dessert; it is a source of happiness, a sweet refuge that brings people together. Its simplicity, combined with its exquisite taste and texture, ensures its enduring popularity, making it a classic indulgence that will never go out of style.

From our current UG, the format for the delete feature is as follows:
Format: `delete [identification] [field]`

I think we are using `[indentification]`, which can be `name` or `id`, instead of `index`.
`[field]` is to be left blank to delete the patient, otherwise the field corresponding to the `[identification]` is deleted.

Perhaps you can remove the quotation marks for CLASS_NAME, I feel that a user would assume the class name to be CLASS_NAME based on the Command Format and so it would be fine to be CLASS_NAME has been added as the successful output (similar to line 165) 😶 

I think standardising the English throughout the document can be tiring so I tried looking through for similar mistakes and found them at line 87, 100, 108, 111, 127, 130. No guarantee that I did not miss out any but I hope this helps! 😄

Hm yeah I feel that command syntax requirements would be a functional requirement since its a must-have for the program we are developing? Although we could phrase it as a NFR by saying `commands should be short and simple enough, limited to around 10 characters for better user experience and readability`. The rest I don't think it matters as much?

LGTM, only real small nitpick is this :

Could maybe add a small statement saying that the empty string in tags is expected because the command is kind of a delete op on tags

Maybe like :

''''suggestion
Expected output:

'edit 1 n/John Sick p/87654321 t/' would display:
'''
Contact edited: John Sick, a Software Engineer from Google 
Changes : 
Name : John Wick >>> John Sick
Phone Number : 12345678 >>>  87654321
Tags : #NUS Alumni #Met in Google Hackathon >>> 
'''
Note that as the command cleared the tags, the changes displayed reflect that the tags are now empty. 
I.e., the empty end-result of Tags is expected.

Just some minor formatting points. Not sure if this matters but I think there should be a space before the parentheses. Also there should probably be a . after each sentence since the first point and the original AB3 has one.

@kiwibang 

Yes, it would be good to discuss @ our weekly meeting how specifically we want to refine the DG (and standardize terms used in the DG + UG + other documentation - Since XA updated Interviewee to Applicant in the UG, we should probably look at refinement of the DG in 1.2).

This version is merely a starting point for us to refine over the next few weeks (with the final refinement process in v1.4) so thank you for all the points raised. We will have to discuss them during the weekly team meeting since the most likely scenario going forward is that everyone would be editing the UG and DG for the relevent features that they are in charge of.

Hi, the use of all 1s was intentional here as it will be converted into the correct numbering when viewed. It is also recommended in the [Markdown style guide](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/markdown.html) for longer lists. However, I realize that it may make more sense to type out the numbering for use cases specifically, as the specific numbers are referenced in the extensions. I'll make the changes here since it makes sense.

@HugeNoob I suppose we should change the 'listing' commands to plural to better reflect its purpose of showing multiplicity?

Yep, I thought the original mockup for AB3 would be largely similar to a new Ui mockup for `listPersons` so i didn't think it was very necessary.

> hi, can u help change the target branch to master so i can see the diff?

@joel-foo done :D
currently, i have `sort-name` and `sort-course` commands which are separate commands that achieve similar results. 
i don't find it maintainable so i am in the midst of changing the code such that we could have various sort functionalities with just one `sort` command. this is something i hope to complete by tomorrow

Closes #27 

Note: Instead of sorting courses by alphabetical order, which may not make any sense because students take multiple courses, I have sorted according to the number of courses taken instead (as mentioned by @Carlintyj).

The address book can now be sorted according to the number of courses taken. 

For example, 
`sort course` command sorts from the most number of courses taken to the least number of courses taken.

**Use case 3: Add a new Expense**

Preconditions: Person exists in the contact list.

**MSS**

1. User requests to view all contacts in the contact list.
2. Spend n Split shows a list of contacts.
3. User enters the command to add a new expense.
4. Spend n Split informs the user that the new expense has been added.
5. Spend n Split shows the updated expense list with that person.

Adds a new appointment to a specific patient at index. Need to include the upcoming date of this new appointment.

Format: add appt /for INDEX /on DATE
Note: 
An appointment must have all tags to work. e.g. add appt, add appt /for 3, add appt /on 2023-09-17 will not work

Examples:
Valid input: add appt /for 6 /on 2023-09-17 13:00
This adds a new appointment to patient at index 6.
Output (success): Appointment added for Drizzy on 17th September, 1pm
Invalid input: add appt /for 6 /on today
Output (failure): Could not add appointment: Date given must be in yyyy-mm-dd HH:mm format!
Invalid input: add appt /for 6
Output (failure): Could not add appointment: Missing appointment details
