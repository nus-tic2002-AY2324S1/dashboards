<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: Resolving JavaFX Cross-Platform Issues with Gradle JavaFX Plugin**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/173" expanded>

## Preface

There has been several issues open about not being able to run the JAR cross-platform for various reasons, most occurring because the Gradle setup for JavaFX was using the following:

```groovy
plugins {
    // ...
    id 'checkstyle'
    id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.0.13'
}

javafx {
    version = '17.0.7'
    modules = ['javafx.base', 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml', 'javafx.graphics']
}
```

The error is a `QuantumReader` error.

## Solution

I was digging through the official OpenJFX documentation to find a potential fix that continued using the (formerly) second method of importing JavaFX in Gradle:

![Screenshot 2023-09-22 at 09 48 38](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/29497029/52c6a140-9774-4cb6-adbf-34c001bd7f6e)

This is my `build.gradle` now. I've tested out the JAR on a Windows ARM build emulated on Mac M1 Pro machine:

```gradle
plugins {
    // ...
    id 'checkstyle'
    id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.0.13'
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.10.0'
    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.10.0'
    implementation group: 'com.google.code.gson', name: 'gson', version: '2.10.1'

    // Used for loops to clean up the imports
    def platforms = ["win", "linux", "mac"]
    def javafxDependency = ["javafx-graphics", "javafx-controls", "javafx-fxml"]

    for (plt in platforms) {
        for (dep in javafxDependency) {
            runtimeOnly "org.openjfx:$dep:$javafx.version:$plt"
        }
    }
}


// ...

javafx {
    version = '17.0.7'
    modules = ['javafx.base', 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml', 'javafx.graphics']
}
```

I am currently setting up VMs (both emulated and virtualized) on a Macbook Pro 14 (M1 Pro) to test various platforms. Would be great if others could try this fix too and see if it resolves their cross-platform issue.

|OS|Architecture|Works?|
|--|------------|------|
|MacOS|ARM (M1 Pro)| ✅ |
|Windows|ARM (Virtualized)| ✅ |
|Windows|x86 (Live Machine)| ✅ |
|Linux|x86 (Ubuntu Live Machine)| ✅ |

Note: I still have the Gradle checkstyle plugin so there is no need to delete it when using this method

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: Auto-expanding all collapsed windows💡**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/103" expanded>

I've noticed that even in the textbook, there are sections in Week 4's slides that are collapsed. So I wrote a quick script in JS to auto-expand all of these sections so it's much easier to search for content:

```js
const collapsibles = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.card-header'))
const uncollapsed = collapsibles.filter(node => {
    const glyph = node.querySelector('.glyphicon')
    if (!glyph) return false;
    return glyph.classList.contains('glyphicon-chevron-right')
})
uncollapsed.forEach(node => node.click())
```

To run it, just open the developer console in the page in question and paste in the script into the console and run it

(Noticed that previous semesters have had similar scripts too)

Hope this helps someone! :)

Usually you would create packages under `src/main/java` instead, not as separate packages under `src`. Inspired by the Maven repository structure which I believe Gradle follows as well: https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html

Both Maven and Gradle are package management tools for Java, similar to `npm` in Javascript or Cargo in Rust

It's likely something to do with redirection relying on a single `System.in`: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27286690/in-java-is-it-possible-to-re-open-system-in-after-closing-it

When reading input from the redirected file, the first Scanner closes `System.in` and so resulting uses of `System.in` will fail. This doesn't occur in manual input since `System.in` is available for each new line you enter

    while (true) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      String input;
      input = sc.nextLine();
      System.out.println(input);
      if (input.equals("bye")) {
        break;
      }
    }

    System.out.println("Outside");

You need `git push --tags` otherwise your tag will not be published

`git tag` alone will only add a tag locally, your remote repository does not contain the tag

I would also add that it's best if you don't try to think of commands as a sequence to memorise but rather as a set of tasks that need to be done, this way it's easier to handle issues like merge conflicts or multiple branches:

1. `git add &gt;file>`: stage the file for the next "snapshot"/commit
2. `git commit -m`: create the "snapshot"/commit with a message
3. `git tag`: provide the current "snapshot"/commit with a human readable tag name
4. `git push`: bring changes from local repository to remote repository, does not include tags
5. `git push --tags`: bring all local tags to remote repository

This way, it's much easier when dealing with larger commits/projects, hope this helps

This seems like a slightly more volatile client-side issue. If there's no guarantee that you are able to assure that all clients can easily view the unicode (and there's no easy way for them to remedy this) why not use `X` instead?

> a solution to set the default encoding when compiling/running the java program using gradle will be required

I'm not entirely sure if this is even possible to dictate for your users through Gradle 🤔 . Once the program is running, your user's terminal encoding is the one that dictates what characters show up.

One really hack-y way is to forcefully set your user's terminal encoding by directly running commands when your bot starts such as using `Runtime.exec()` (https://www.baeldung.com/run-shell-command-in-java). You could try playing around with the `LC_ALL` of the user's configuration to see if that ensures "global" viewing but as pointed out in [this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36184019/is-it-possible-force-utf-8-in-a-c-program), doing this could be a very slippery slope as the user's encoding affects things outside of just displaying the symbols

For Unix systems, `LC_ALL` seems to be sufficient but for Windows, you might need to try this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35549962/lc-all-c-equivalent-for-windows-using-powershell

Just recompile the files with Java 11 and they'll be "Java 11". You don't have to downgrade your Java version. `jenv` is a way to manage multiple Java installations (if you're on MacOS): https://www.jenv.be/

If you're on Windows, believe you can just install Java 11 and point the path variable to the Java 11 installation instead (but I've not used Windows in quite a while so any Windows folks, feel free to correct me)

Usually, I would always put my entry point class outside of all other subpackages at the root of my folder so the structure is like this:

```
src/main/java/duke
    utility/
    commands/
    Duke.java

To me this makes the most sense since the entry point does not belong in any subpackage

To follow up on this, this section of ShadowJar's docs is probably relevant: https://imperceptiblethoughts.com/shadow/configuration/#configuring-output-name

For `archiveJarName`, it's a Gradle attribute so you can refer to [the website](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Jar.html):

I think the main idea is to have a **logical separation** of concerns and to not create new classes for the sake of creating a class. This goes back to what the problem is. Let's say you are trying to implement a builder pattern, out of necessity, a secondary (usually nested) `Builder` class is needed. This is a logical separation of work since you need this `Builder` class for you to be able to properly implement the pattern. An instance where creating a class for the sake of creating a class is going to be redundant is in cases where you have a single utility method used in a single location but you try abstracting it out into a "utility" class just because you can. In those scenarios, I would just leave the utility method in the class it is used since it's not going to ever be used outside.

Besides the "need" concern, I think a bigger component of modularity is the ability to have finer unit testing. Larger modules/classes imply that you have a lot more surface area to cover for a unit test. This is not a bad thing per-se but being able to modularize the code means that you decouple long dependency chains so that each unit test covers exactly one component and does not have to overextend its testing. One very good example is the `Parser` class in iP where having a separate class means you can individually test `parse()` without having to worry about setting up the file storage or making sure the bot is running.

For most web frameworks (think Gin for Go, Spring Boot for Java, Phoenix for Elixir), it is not uncommon to see a high level of modularity when building out a single endpoint. Usually you have a router to handle the web routes, then you have a controller to handle the HTTP request, and then a set of models that the controller uses, and finally a data layer that connects with the database. This modularity, while verbose and tedious at times, gives a very clear flow of what goes where and the roles each class/module plays. Even in desktop applications, you might see architectures like the Model-View-Controller (MVC) where you already have three layers of modularity.

Tl;dr: dividing into multiple classes is a double edged sword, it gives clear visibility and responsibility to each file which makes testing a lot easier but overdoing it because you can is bound to make the code more unreadable and harder to navigate

I've forked your repository and managed to rectify the issue. The primary issue is the use of `Pane` to wrap your dialog messages (for some odd reason, it does not allow the wrap text to work as expected). You can use `HBox` to arrange the content already. You also need to configure the parent container (`VBox` in `ScrollPane`) to have a fixed width too. I've updated the view through FXML directly so I removed the `children` nodes but the general logic applies. You might want to re-adjust some of the values I hardcoded to suit your needs but believe it's best to show what changes were needed:

To give some more context for future reference (and those who encounter similar issue). The fixes that I applied are as such:

1. Remove the use of Pane since `HBox` already handles alignment of content
2. Remove the `prefHeight` attribute of the `VBox` inside `ScrollPane` since that would cause scrolling issues with longer texts from my experience
3. Set the `prefWidth` of the `Label` directly so that there is a specified container size
4. Set the background styling directly onto the `Label`, not the `Pane`

I generally try to think of FXML + CSS in terms of HTML flexbox so that helps with understanding the way to layout content

Could I ask why you want to compile the files? 

Once you start importing public libraries, it becomes increasingly more challenging to manually compile the code. You do not need to manually compile your Java code with Gradle since it does it for you. That's the whole purpose of using a package management tool instead of manually downloading and managing your dependencies (see CMake and C++ for why this is tedious and painful)

The reason this is failing is because Gradle downloaded the dependencies from the internet and you are not including them when you compile your programs

Edit: manually compiling all the JavaFX dependencies would mean downloading the JAR files and using the following command: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9395207/how-to-include-jar-files-with-java-file-and-compile-in-command-prompt

The `.idea/` folder is ignored by `.gitignore`. Also, I don't seem to see a `config/checkstyle/configuration.xml` in your project root. The instructions from the notes should be done sequentially, so once you setup the `configuration.xml`, then you can add it to the Intellij project

I personally do not see an alternative to testing it as is. I view unit testing practices as guidelines that should be done when possible. In this scenario, if you are worried about the reliability of returning the instance `Bar`, then the thing you should focus on is not the fact that there is a dependency, but rather, making sure that `Bar` is properly unit tested separately. This way, you are "guaranteed" that `fooMethod` would not be buggy.

The key here is to make sure `Bar` is independently tested (or as much as it can be) and that way, you are sure there is no issues returning a new instance of it from `Foo`. You shouldn't need to test the `Bar` object returned from `fooMethod` inside `Foo` since then you would have overlapping unit tests. So there's two separate test files, `BarTest` and `FooTest` and you don't mix the unit tests

That's my take on this

I think this really boils down to what is defined as a magic literal. An interesting paper I found was this: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584922000908

And it defines magic literals as 

> Magic literals are such values used without an explicit explanation of their meaning.

So the key component to what makes magic literals magic is the fact that there is a lack of **explicit** explanation of their meaning. In the case of 'String.format()', the strings that you use are self-explanatory, they are simply the contents to print and the interpolated variables should be explained in their own ways. So I don't think that this is a magic literal and it does not affect the readability of the code.

As for whether it is alright to use magic strings, I see this as being a similar problem to writing SQL code in another language. For instance, is it better to include the SQL query directly like (using Go to illustrate but the idea applies):

'''go
db.Query('
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE username = $1
', username)
'''

Or if it's better to abstract this query into a separate string such as:

'''go
const QUERY = '
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE username = $1
'

db.Query(QUERY, username)
'''

I think in this case, having an extra layer of abstraction might actually make it harder to understand the intent of the code and make it harder to trace. You could imagine the 'QUERY' being stored in a separate file so you will have to jump between files to figure out these magic literals. I think the SQL string is self-explanatory, albeit slightly long but it doesn't really violate SLAP since it's still along the same level of abstraction.

This is just my take on this though, would love to hear what others think!

> Moving it to one location as a NAMED_CONSTANT can make future updates to it easier and less error-prone.

I agree, however, I might argue that if it's used in `String.format()`, it's unlikely to be reused so moving it to another location could be considered as a premature optimisation that might not be necessary. I think this really boils down to the context and use case of the literal.

This is my `build.gradle` now. I've tested out the JAR on a Windows ARM build emulated on Mac M1 Pro machine:

```gradle
dependencies {
    testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.10.0'
    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.10.0'
    implementation group: 'com.google.code.gson', name: 'gson', version: '2.10.1'

    // Used for loops to clean up the imports
    def platforms = ["win", "linux", "mac"]
    def javafxDependency = ["javafx-graphics", "javafx-controls", "javafx-fxml"]

    for (plt in platforms) {
        for (dep in javafxDependency) {
            runtimeOnly "org.openjfx:$dep:$javafx.version:$plt"
        }
    }
}


// ...

javafx {
    version = '17.0.7'
    modules = ['javafx.base', 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml', 'javafx.graphics']
}
```

Would be great if others could help perform a quick smoke test on native Windows machines. Perhaps this was the fix missing for the second method of setting up JavaFX:

|OS|Architecture|Works?|
|--|------------|------|
|MacOS|ARM (M1 Pro)| ✅ |
|Windows|ARM (Emulated)| ✅ |
|Windows|x86 (Native)| |

Edit: this is not just runtest.bat it seems, I tried running it on VSCode, and it doesn't work
However, running it in IntelliJ works, even though I have made sure that the file being run is the original file, not Gradle's run

Thank you, but that wasn't really my concern
My problem is how to remove the --scan and --info flags from the command, since everytime i click on build task in gradle toolbox, those two flags will be activated

I got a checkstyle violation before but without those two flags, so the text was shorter and easier to read. I'm trying to revert it back to before (I don't have the screenshot since I can't revert it back yet)

Thank You Prof, it works perfectly..
However, now I don't know how to fix the runtest.bat, given this information

@ECHO OFF

REM create bin directory if it doesn't exist
if not exist ..\bin mkdir ..\bin

REM delete output from previous run
if exist ACTUAL.TXT del ACTUAL.TXT

REM compile the code into the bin folder
javac  -cp ..\src\main\java\duke -Xlint:none -d ..\bin ..\src\main\java\duke\*.java
IF ERRORLEVEL 1 (
    echo ********** BUILD FAILURE **********
    exit /b 1
)
REM no error here, errorlevel == 0

REM run the program, feed commands from input.txt file and redirect the output to the ACTUAL.TXT
java -classpath ..\bin Duke &gt; input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT

REM compare the output to the expected output
FC ACTUAL.TXT EXPECTED.TXT


That is my current runtest.bat, which cannot compile and shows the 'package does not exist' error shown previously. Which part of the file do I change so that it can compile? Thanks very much.

It seems that you are just trying to test a constructor, instead of testing whether the instance created fulfills any requirements. Test cases like this can only have bugs when Bar is an abstract class, its constructor is private, etc. I think before testing we can ask ourselves "What are we testing for ?", Is it just to check whether that constructor correctly creates that instance for you or any other requirements?

Hi guys, thank you for the suggestions. When I went to check the list of files using command E, I was unable to see the gradle in the tools tab.

My jar file (made on Mac) also yielded linkage errors for Windows. My issue was resolved when I ran java --version on the terminal. Turns out, I was using OpenJDK version 20, and had to downgrade to 11 by manually deleting the other OpenJDK files of the other versions.

The code below was given for the task in week 2 where we have to extract out the classes `Storage`, `TaskList` and `Ui`. 

```java
public class Duke {
    private Storage storage;
    private TaskList tasks;
    private Ui ui;

    public Duke(String filePath) {

Could I ask if exact naming standard are imposed? (in other words, if my `TaskList` class is called `CustomList`, will it still be accepted? Or do I have to rename it due to possible automated script checks?)

On top of what @larrywang0701 has said, the iP dashboard is updated daily. So you might need to come back tommorow to see if the script has detected your tag.

If you are still facing issues, you can use these following commands. 

1. Open up your terminal and navigate to your iP folder
2. Type command `git log` to list all the recent commits

For example, mine looks like this:
![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/96157054/c80d85d6-a39a-47cb-a104-7a180a7fba6e)

&hat;My tag above is listed with the merge commit, so I know the merge commit has been tagged correctly. 

From your screenshot, it seems to me that your tag is not attached to the merge commit, which might be what is causing the issue.

1. Run `git log` and make sure all your commits are synced with your local repositiory
2. Delete the old tag from your local repository using `git tag -d &gt;tag-name>`
3. Create the tag on the new commit using `git tag &gt;tag-name> &gt;hash-of-the-merge-commit>`
4. Delete the old tag from the remote repositiory `git push origin --delete &gt;tag-name>`
5. Push the new tag to the remote repository `git push origin &gt;tag-name>`

This method has worked for me before, and it should for you as well 😊

Ok, looks like a Intellij environment related problem. 

**Compare environment between terminal and intellij**
Run `./gradelew -g` from the command line to print the environment variables and system properties. Compare this to the environment in Intellij(`Run` > `Edit Configurations` > `Environment variables`) to make sure if they match.

Update it here if possible also!

**Delete all .idea and .iml files**
These files could have become corrupted. Delete them and relaunch Intellij. Intellij should restore those fiiles.

Actually I think i noticed the culprit. In the image that you attached at the start of the thread, I noticed that you have a `ParserTest` class that is not in a subdirectory of its own. 

You can do following.
1. If your `Parser` class is not in a package, house it under a package. 
2. Then, make sure the test directory follows the **SAME** file structure as your main code. 

I would expect the `ParserTest` to be under a nested directory and not hanging outside by itself, if this is done correctly. 

Reasoning:
Intellij attempts to understand your file structure and generates test build based off its understanding. So, it is highly likely Intellij has misinterpreted your file stucture. As to why your tests run correctly with your `gradelew` command, I think it is because the build was generated before you made some code changes. Those code changes between the last time you built the jar artifact and now is what caused your test to not run correctly in Intellij.

Further help:
Could you share your full test structure if you don't mind? 

Let me know if this helps in any way

Referring to the image above, `ParserTest` seems to be under package Duke, but from the file structure of your main code, it seems `Parser` is in `main` > `java` > `Duke` > `Tasks` > `Parser`. So I believe the correct test directory should be to move the `ParserTest` into the `Tasks` test directory.

It seems Intellij itself doesn't recognise the test file in this directory, as `ParserTest` is notably highlighted in blue.

I believe the problem is in your build gradle file. Even though in the build task, you have indicated option for `depends on("distZip", "distJar")`, shadow jar probably didn't detect any dependencies associated with those (other) distributions.

Maybe you could try modifying the dependencies task your build gradle file to this 

```java
dependencies {
    testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.10.0'
    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.10.0'
    testImplementation 'org.mockito:mockito-core:3.12.4'

    String javaFxVersion = '17.0.8'

    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'

    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-graphics', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-controls:17.0.8'
}
```
Of course, this would install javaFx version 17.0.8 in your repository (change it to your preferred version)

> &hat;The above is mine. Seems like that might be the issue since it looks like there are only distributions for mac OS but not other OSes. However, my build.gradle file does not have what you have since I used the second method to do set up JavaFX. Adding your recommended dependencies breaks my checkstyle file. Thanks for the hint though!!

**Old dependencies that worked**
```java
org.openjfx:javafx-fxml:mac-aarch64:17:0:7

Yes yes, the linkage error is caused by Java Fx dependencies. A couple of people who used Java Fx on Mac have faced the same problem regarding the jar file distribution. Hopefully we can find a solution to this.

Is this a cross-platform issue that you are facing? (Developed on Windows/Linux but distribution on Mac failed?)
You could refer to #159 and try modifying your build gradle before packaging the jar file. 

Or this is problem faced on your local Macbook? (My guess would be this)
You could refer to #118 (Java fx runtime components missing...)

I clicked take quiz again on accident even though I submitted a quiz already, do I have to fill it in and submit again?

Asking because in 2100 they take the marks of the lastest submitted quiz, so if I don't fill up the resubmission, canvas will automatically submit a blank response at the end and I will get 0 marks

But I still get an error for the line length.

Also, when I change the length in the XML file to 180, it does fix the issue, but the checkstyle off is buggy nonetheless

I had a very niche and difficult issue with nullpointer/failure to load even though my filepath was correct.

Because the github code base was in a cloud drive I’m not sure why but it caused issues. After many hours I tried moving the whole code to local desktop and without changing any code it worked just like that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

@woojiahao 

Thanks for your help! I believe I have had both Java 11 and Java 17 installed previously.

My particular error:

My steps of resolving the error:
1. File -&gt; Project Structure -&gt; SDK (choose 11) -&gt; Language Level (choose Default) -&gt; Apply -&gt; OK. (https://www.baeldung.com/intellij-change-java-version from CS2040S setup / @woojiahao )

2. IntelliJ IDEA (beside File) -&gt; Build, Execution, Deployment -&gt; Compiler -&gt; Java Compiler -&gt; Project bytecode version (set to 11) -&gt; Apply -&gt; OK. (from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67098514/java-error-release-version-17-not-supported)

3. Build (same menu bar as File and IntelliJ IDEA) -&gt; Rebuild Project.

Hi @lsyurea 
Currently my attempt is to follow the guide link sent by @shishirbychapur (the alternative way for gradle stated on CS2103T website). I'm able to get the GUI, but still have this warning

A very good evening @damithc . Thank you so much for the clarification. 
With that in mind, I would conclude that the feasible way for me to solve the issue is by following this guide. https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#gradle stated by @shishirbychapur .

Hi @s-peiran. 
My steps are:
1. Create a branch base on the content of master.
2. Make edits on branch.
3. Commit changes to branch.
4. Merge branch into master. (I guess you've missed this and hence your master is not up to date with branch 7?)
5. Make tag for this comit.
6. Push master, new branch, and all tags. (When you click the Push in Sourcetree, you need to check the checkboxes of master and the branch, and also  the push all tags.
7. Repeat the steps for next task.

I spotted that you've merge master into branch 7 which might cause a bit problem -- you're updating branch 7 but not master.

Hi @Vanessamae23 ,

If this "implementation group" method still does not work for you, you could consider referring to issue #72  in closed issues. In short, use the alternative way (adding the `javafx {  }` block).

I then thought that it might be due to gradle not recognising these files as test files, therefore I marked the src/test/java folder as a test source root:

Previously, I solved this encoding issue by adding jvm arguments when running the application:
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath ../bin Duke < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT

I have tried the following approaches:
1. setting the system property at the entry of my application:2. 
public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.setProperty("file.encoding", "UTF-8");
        new Duke("data", "tasks.json").run();
    }

2. modifying the following part of the build.gradle file:
application {
    mainClass.set("duke.Duke")
    applicationDefaultJvmArgs = ["-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"]
}

Does anyone have any suggestion on how I can solve this issue?

I have looked through the stack overflow and tried the suggestions provided in there, however, the issue is still not solved at my side. A quick look at my settings:

However, as mentioned by prof @damithc, we do not have control over what kind of terminal users will use to run our application, a solution to set the default encoding when compiling/running the java program using gradle will be required.

Would definitely appreciate more suggestions as I am kind of clueless now on what other ways are the to solve this issue.

I think that your bot should check if the file exists, if it does it should load that file at the start to show the previous tasks, if it does not it can create the file and maybe tell the user that it has created a file. Then after each command, it updates the file accordingly.

Hi @TiwKangXu ,

I agree with @geraldngjx that I think the issue leading to this error might be that your main class name in build.gradle and your actual package name in your code.

For me, my Duke.java is located such that: src > main > java > duke > Duke.java. Therefore, my build.gradle looks like:

application {
mainClass.set("duke.Duke")
}

You can just clean your build using gradle and rename your mainClass or package name to make them consistent, before repeating the steps for A-Jar using gradle.

My GUI looks pretty much like the one in the JavaFX tutorial except that I chaged the images for Duke and the User. For anyone who had troubles with their text becoming an ellipsis in the dialog box, you can remove the prefHeight in the VBox in the MainWindow.fxml

Hello professor and classmates

When my iP program starts to run (both in IDEA and running the fat jar with `java -jar` command), the GUI window currectly pops out, but also leaving a warning message in the console
`Unsupported JavaFX configuration: classes were loaded from 'unnamed module @xxxxxxxx'`
(where xxxxxxxx is some random hexadecimal numbers, seems like some kind of object address)
Since it seems that this warning doesn't affect anything in my iP (everything works well except the warning itself), should I just submit the final version of my iP ignoring this warning, or should I fix that before submission? If I need to fix this warning, what should I do? 
(I confirm that JavaFX is inside my fat jar since when I unzip my jar file I see all javafx files inside)
Since the deadline for final iP submission is approaching, if this warning won't affect grading or any other thing, I may just ignore it  and save more time for checking and finalizing other things in iP.
Thanks!

Hello professors and classmates

At the first day when I started using SourceTree, I noticed that whenever I push to remote repo, a window will pop up:
![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/113608053/e74aaeb6-18b0-4235-a359-5cf0a24245a9)
It will pop twice with the same content, and I just directly click the "select" button twice.

But these days I found out that this window also automatically pops even though I didn't do any push actions or actions related to the remote repo. Same as when I manually push to remote repos, it pops twice. Sometimes I just left SourceTree stays in the system background without closing it, and when I was doing other things with my device, this window also frequently pops up randomly at any time. (Even when I'm writing this question now, it pops again in the background!) **Just like SourceTree is pushing something to the remote repo by itself even without my comfirmation???** Since weeks ago it won't like this, so I tried to solve it. But I couldn't solve it and even deleting all files in local repo then re-clone from remote repo won't solve. Could someone told me why this window pops automatically in the background randomly (without any direction operation or action from me) and how to solve this problem? (My OS is Windows 10) Thanks.

Hello professors and classmates.
From my prior project experiences, I believe that making more classes in my OOP framework will make the overall framework more flexible, modularized and easy to expand, maintaince and use. But one day when I was in high school, my teacher told me that not all programs needs such amount of divided classes and such large framework since designing the framework itself is also time-costly and too-large framework may also be bad. This is totally differ from what I previously believed. So I'm curious about the answer to this question. **Does "dividing everything into separate classes" really a good practice in SE?** Thanks!

From my experiences, commonly when your program needs to store files locally (I've used this before in my video game projects, about storing player records for the game), here is what I usually do:
```
First, check whether the specific file exists on the disk
  If the file not exists, use one of the two options below:
    --Create the file and initialize the file with initial contents. Then check whether the creation is successful or not. (Exception may happen when space is not enough, doesn't have permission (e.g.: Windows UAC) etc. ) and preceed to the next step
    --Use initial data for this user session, skip the next step and write data later in the write phase (actually I prefer this one)
  If the file exists:
    Preceed to the next step
Second, preceed read/write the file like normal. (the so-called "next step" in the above sentences)
```

So to your question, option 2 is much more reasonable than option 1 since users are not expected to create the data file by themselves in this situation. And what's more, I think you don't need to ask the user whether to save the file, just save it automatically to increase the ease of usage.

Try "Level-x" with uppercase "L" instead of lowercase in your tag name? (I'm not sure whether the dashboard system is case sensitive or not)  (update: I see your level-8 can be detacted from your screenshot, so this may not be the main reason for your problem)
Also, go to check that whether you really **created the branch** for level 8, javadoc, coding standard and level 9 and then merge and then tag the merged comment in master branch as required?

No from his screenshot he tagged his commit 5 days ago already @AlagappanRa 
As his branches are also not detacted, I guess he may failed to follow the branch requirements in iP, thus causing the problem (just guessing)

I can not see your branch names from your screenshot, so it's hard for me to give you more helpful information. But instead of just correcting your correct commits, why not try deleting all of your current tags that can not be correctly detacted, **then follow the iP requirements last week starting from A-Packages again all over again?**
Since from my experience, Github commits is really easy to messed up if you are not sure what you are doing (**you may make more mistakes and make your repo more messy during fixing**), so just redo everything may be better than try to fix the current wrong one.

But still weird, though your tags may not be pushed, why your branches on the right is also red?
Did you also forget to push your branches to the remote repo?
I push everytime I make a commit or tag a commit so I never encounter a problem like yours.
Tomorrow if the dashboard is updated but your detaction is still red, then you may need to come back again.

> @lihongguang00 You are mixing up commit messages with tags. Previously, you used `Level-0` etc. as commit messages instead of tags. That's why there were no tags in your repo. When doing a release, GitHub automatically creates a tag, but that is just a side effect, not the intended way to create a tag.

Hi prof, I'm new to git and it's quite confusing so please correct me if my current sequence of git commands is wrong. 

`git add &gt;file>`
`git commit -m &gt;commit_header> -m &gt;commit_message>`
`git tag &gt;relevant_tag>`
`git push`

My current understanding is that using `git tag &gt;relevant_tag>` creates the tag on the latest commit?

Another thing you can try is to push a commit to your fork (e.g. ammend the README file) and create a pull request.

Sorry if this is a last minute question, but I realised I did not use FXML as I found it more intuitive to add different UI elements with JavaFX on its own. I was wondering if this would get me penalised under making a GUI at least as good as the original.

Below is my code, and it currently runs smoothly. Why does adding the commented out line under handleUserInput (sendButton.setDisabled(true)) cause the following error? I cannot see why an unrelated line of code would cause an import error.

From website:

Q. How are the iP git tags used in grading?

A. Adding a git tag in the iP is a self-declaration that you think you are done with the iP increment. We take your word for it. We don't check the code to see if you have actually done the said increment. Therefore, it is just a mechanism for you to self-declare progress and for us to monitor those progress declarations.

So I think you can just change it at the Level-5 commit onwards

Hey, I would like to suggest trying out the [second method](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#gradle). 
I could not set up JavaFX properly with the first method too but this one worked for me! I tweaked the steps a little to make it work for my project and the import statements (finally) got recognized :)

Setup steps(some steps are slightly different since the version of JavaFX that the tutorial uses is JavaFX 17.0.7):
1. In your build.gradle file, add the following to your `build.gradle` file on top of your existing plugins:
(this adds the JavaFX plugin for Gradle)
```
plugins {
    id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.0.13'
}
```
2. In your `build.gradle` file, also add the following:
(the snippet below specifies that JavaFX 17.0.7 should be used, and that we need the 'javafx.controls' & 'javafx.fxml' modules, FXML can be omitted if you do not plan to use FXML to develop your chatbot GUI)
```
javafx {
    version = "17.0.7"
    modules = [ 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml' ]
}
```
3. Run your `build.gradle` file:
- Linux/Mac: `./gradlew run`
- Windows: `gradlew run`

Really hope this helps! Jiayous!

Ok thanks prof. I have taken these steps so far:
- Revert all traces of the second step by removing the JavaFX SDK and updating build.gradle to the first method
- loaded gradle changes
- ran: ./gradlew build
- Managed to get the project structure to the state that @AlagappanRa described:

- However, this change breaks the following:
- The checkstyle: It seems to completely ignore the existence of the main file but somehow can run checks on the test file:

Hi Delton, I think you can refer to the additions to the build.gradle file that @AlagappanRa mentioned [above](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/159#issuecomment-1728708305).

Thanks @AlagappanRa :)

As for the checkstyle breaking, it turns out that I did not delete the module-info.java file from my repo, which is required for the first method of installing but not the second. So if anyone is reverting to the first method of including JavaFX, you might want to follow the steps below for reverting to the first method:
- Remove any JavaFX SDKs that you might have installed for the second method(delete it from whereever that you might have placed the JavaFX SDK in when you first set up JavaFX)
- Remove these lines that you had to add for the second method from your `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
javafx {
    version = "17.0.7"
    modules = [ 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml' ]
}
```
- Delete any module-info.java files(not needed for including JavaFX using the first method)
- Include these lines in your dependencies file(credits: @AlagappanRa):
```gradle
dependencies {
    // JavaFX 17.0.7 dependencies for macOS on ARM64
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-base:17.0.7:mac-aarch64'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-controls:17.0.7:mac-aarch64'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-fxml:17.0.7:mac-aarch64'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-graphics:17.0.7:mac-aarch64' 

    // JavaFX 17.0.7 dependencies for Linux
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-base:17.0.7:linux'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-controls:17.0.7:linux'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-fxml:17.0.7:linux'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-graphics:17.0.7:linux'

    // JavaFX 17.0.7 dependencies for Windows
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-base:17.0.7:win'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-controls:17.0.7:win'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-fxml:17.0.7:win'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-graphics:17.0.7:win'
}
```
- note: what the above lines do is to include distributions for other OSes(as described in the comments), so the resulting jar file generated will be cross-platform(I have yet to try it out on other OSes but I will keep everyone posted)
- Next, run `./gradlew build` in order to set up the project dependencies to include the required JavaFX components in your project
- Verify that the dependencies have been added by going to `File -&gt; Project Structure -&gt; Project Settings -&gt; Modules -&gt; Dependencies`. You should see the below:

- Ensure your ip still works by running your ip as per usual
- Ensure that your checkstyle still works after making the above changes(if applicable)

**Update: The jar file works on multiple platforms**

TL:DR - Ensure the following:
- Correct JDK version(especially for mac users)
- `build.gradle` for the javaFX components is configured correctly
- If reverting from the second version of setting up JavaFX to the first, ensure that all traces of the second method are deleted(e.g. the JavaFX JDK & `module-info.java`)
- JavaFX dependencies are present in the project structure

Last but not least, I would like to thank everyone for their help in helping me to resolve these issues!! :))

I haven't had any issues working across Windows and macOS with the same git repository. 

However, I have faced issues when accessing the same repository on Windows WSL (Ubuntu) as described in: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53900839/git-repo-gives-contradictory-info-from-wsl-than-from-windows

TLDR: Difference in the way line endings are interpreted causes conflicts on every line.

> Do you mean that if every team member applies `git config --global core.autocrlf true` in their local machine, then the team should no longer face conflicts arising due to line ending representations across different operating systems?

You can read https://blog.chapagain.com.np/git-fix-differences-created-by-line-endings-in-files/ and https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration (search autocrlf) for more information on the differences.

TLDR: 
If you don't face any issues, then I guess it's fine to leave things as they are. Otherwise, you can do:  
`git config --global core.autocrlf true` on Windows
`git config --global core.autocrlf input` on macOS/Linux

I'm not 100% sure about whether everyone needs to do this on their own machine. I think it suffices if the person facing the conflicts does it. Would be good if more people can confirm.

It seems like you haven't pushed your tags to GitHub.

When you run `git tag` on your machine, it only creates the tags in your local repository. Doing `git push` will only push your commits to the remote repository, and will not include the tags you have created locally. You have to do an extra step of `git push --tags` to push your local tags to the remote repository. 

See https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/22#issuecomment-1691864201 for an overview of what you should be doing.

In my opinion, there are two factors to consider:
1. How many people are working together on the repository?
2. Which branch are you pushing to?

For iP, since you're working alone on the project, it's probably quite reasonable to do so. If you don't like having buggy code in `master`, you could always branch out to resolve the code first, then merge back into `master` later on. If you really hate buggy commits in particular, you can do things like `git commit --amend` or `git rebase` to clear buggy commits after you fix them, but note that those will probably require a force push afterward.

For tP, you probably want to avoid pushing to branches that are shared with your group mates, in case they accidentally pull from them. I'm not sure what the tP structure is, but if it's done in forks, then it shouldn't be a big issue anyway.

I am confused regarding how to implement assertions for Week 5 project. Are we supposed to run Duke.main()? Because earlier in Week 4 - Project, this was mentioned:

``` Note that you no longer need to keep the text-based UI after adding a GUI. Similarly, there is no need to use the I/O redirection style automated testing anymore (that technique is suited for text UIs only). ```

So do we still have to maintain our text-based UI on top of our GUI chatbot? Because from my understanding, assertions are only relevant when you run Duke.main, and are not relevant when you run the GUI chatbot. I ask this because I get this error when I try to run Duke.main ```JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application```, and so I'm wondering if I need to fix this or simply remove everything that is not related to running the GUI chatbot

Thanks all for replies! The issue was that the working directory where my main method was run from was different from where my runtest.bat was run from, so when I tried to run runtest.bat there were issues due to the wrong relative pathing. Fixed it by running runtest.bat from the IP directory instead of the text-ui-test directory, but because of this had to change certain parts of runtest.bat to point to the correct ACTUAL.TXT and EXPECTED.TXT

While working on Level-7, I encountered a strange issue:
```
File taskFile = new File(somePathToATxtFile);
            Scanner setup = new Scanner(taskFile);
           //some intermediate code 
            while(setup.hasNext()){
                //load task into the list
                //while loop does not loop
            }
```
In this piece of code, i try to initialize my list with tasks in the txt file, but the task is not loaded into the list.

```
File taskFile = new File(somePathToATxtFile);
            Scanner setup = new Scanner(taskFile);
           //some intermediate code 
           if(setup.hasNext()){
               System.out.println("hasNext"); //this piece of code runs!
           }
            while(setup.hasNext()){
                //load task into the list
                //while loop starts looping
            }
```
for some reason when I check if the setup scanner is empty or not, the tasks are now loaded into the list!

Can someone explain why checking if the scanner hasNext fixes this code?

regarding the issue mentioned in [https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/6](url) , the following error rises when a "new" Scanner is created during a while loop that doesn't terminate until "bye" is detected:
```
Exception in thread "main" java.util.NoSuchElementException: No line found
        at java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextLine(Scanner.java:1656)
        at Cracker.startService(Cracker.java:15)
        at Cracker.main(Cracker.java:67)
 
```
Why does this arise when manually entering the input does not throw any exceptions?
My hypothesis is that System.in throws the .txt file into the scanner and when a new Scanner is created, the txt file is somehow cleared.

Apparently you can only close Scanners once.
when I tried running the code above, i would be returned with a NoSuchElementException.
Why doesn't declaring a new Scanner reopen the Scanner?

Apparently, I have found some crucial code that caused the while loop to terminate.
The problem is i tried to open a new FileWriter that passed in the same file in the Scanner.
Here is a code that demonstrates this: 
```
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ScannerTester {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        FileWriter writer = null;
        File taskFile = new File("./data/list.txt");
        Scanner setup = null ;

        try{
            setup = new Scanner(taskFile);
            writer = new FileWriter(taskFile);
        } catch (Exception e){
            System.out.println(e);
        }
        System.out.println(setup.hasNext());
        while(setup.hasNext()){
            System.out.println(setup.next());
        }
        

    }
} 
```
The output will be false.
Running setup.hasNext() before creating the FileWriter will fix the problem for some reason, and the while loop will start looping. This still confuses me.

Thanks for the answer! This certainly explains why I can't retrieve any more lines from the Scanner. However, this code below works for some reason.
```
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ScannerTester {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        FileWriter writer = null;
        File taskFile = new File("./data/list.txt");
        Scanner setup = null ;

        try{
            setup = new Scanner(taskFile);
            setup.hasNext(); //adding this line activates the loop
            writer = new FileWriter(taskFile);
        } catch (Exception e){
            System.out.println(e);
        }
        System.out.println(setup.hasNext());
        while(setup.hasNext()){
            System.out.println(setup.next());
        }
        

    }
} 
```
Here's how i understand this program:
After I input the file into the scanner, i check hasNext() and should return true (Have not opened filewriter yet)
Afterwards i open the fileWriter, flushing the entire file.
When check the condition of the while loop, it will fail and nothing will happen.

However, adding that one line before opening the fileWriter changes something and I'm not sure how.

Hi I am trying to style my GUI to make it look better. I referred to the code written by @shishirbychapur (Thank you so much and I credited you in my code). However, after I created a chat bubble for containing the text message, I am unable to wrap the text. Previously, I was able to wrap my text with the most basic GUI.

The `Label `that contained my message already has `wrapText = "true"` and I feel that probably something else is interfering with it. 
However, I cannot find out exactly where is the problem. 😢

Thank you for those who took the time to help me debug. I have solved the problem by running git bash instead of Ubuntu. I believe it is a Ubuntu problem. I tried switching to powershell / command prompt first but their commands are different from the Linux commands I am used to. Git bash provides a command line interface for the windows system, emulating the linux environment. Hence simpler for me. Hope there won't be any more problems.

I'm not very bright so please bear with my clarification.

Do you mean that if every team member applies `git config --global core.autocrlf true` in their local machine, then the team should no longer face conflicts arising due to line ending representations across different operating systems?

Hello everyone!

I'm seeking volunteers to help me conduct a smoke test on my ip release which is currently available on GitHub. While I've tested on a Mac, I'm particularly interested in how it performs on non-Mac machines.

### **Details**
- **Repository:** Tim-Siu/ip
- **Release:** [A-Release](https://github.com/Tim-Siu/ip/releases/tag/A-Release)

Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated!

I was following a JavaFX tutorial, but I've encountered a problem where my dialogue text label seems to automatically collapse when there's not enough space. I would appreciate some guidance on how to resolve this.

I noticed while we were adding gradle support for the iP that we push the gradle-wrapper.jar file into the repository. This is a binary file that's generated when one of the [Gradle wrapper scripts](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.wrapper.Wrapper.html) run for the first time.

The documentation itself does say we should push this to the remote, but doesn't this directly contradict the idea that we shouldn't push binaries to the repository? Can't we get the users to generate this file themselves?

@JasonRay You need to add the `@FXML` labels to `dialog` and `displayPicture` - otherwise your FXML files will not be able to detect the variables.

You can see this from your error message - its leading you to line 41 with a `NullPointerException` - you are calling `setText` on an uninitialized label, so it's not automatically loading in from the FXML file.

> The 2 fields dialog and displayPicture were used, but the corresponding field declarations at the top was not highlighted purple, meaning it is not used

Regarding this, the IDE doesn't seem to detect variable usage in FXML files, even with the `@FXML` tag - don't be too alarmed by this.

Hey @zacwong2151, I believe you can use the path `./data/duke.txt` to fix this issue - the IDE runs the program as if the `ip` folder is the root.

On a side note, you can look into the `java.nio.file.Paths` library - in particular, the `Paths.get` method can generate a relative path that is usable across different OS platforms, without having to deal with the file separators.

@woojiahao Forgive me for being out of the loop here, but I don't really understand what you mean by "second method of importing JavaFX into gradle". Was there a section that I had missed on the site? I had followed the JavaFX tutorial [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFxPart1.html) so I am unaware about a second method.

OK, so it seems like this was a Java version issue - the Mac that this was tested on was not the one given in the advisory, and due to some miscommunication, we had thought that changing the version did not fix the issue when it in fact it had fixed it.

One interesting thing that had arose here though was that the tester was using Java Launcher to test the jar files - from what I can see Java Launcher could only test 1 of the 3 jar files she was supplied with from different iP projects, but the other 2 jar files could only be launched without error from the terminal using `java -jar nameOfJar.jar`.

The only major difference I could see in the build.gradle files for that jar file compared to the other 2 was the inclusion of the `checkstyle` module (possibly related to [this](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/159#issuecomment-1729226821)). The 2 jar files that failed to run had the `checkstyle` module configured while the 1 that ran did not have it at all.

While the errors have been resolved, I would still appreciate if additional people could test if they can open the program on Mac to confirm if the program can run on the OS.

Relative path is the location of the file relative to the working directory while absolute relative is location from the root directory. Based on @WZWren reply, you can also trace back after generating the relative file path to have a better understanding of how it works

I agree with @kokrui, we can also dedicate a separate `txt` file for when we run `runtest.sh` (and purging it before every run). What I did was to allow `Duke` to access different files via different pathnames. 

I've also noticed that the relative pathnames resolve differently in `Duke.java` and when we use `runtest.sh`.

Hey, I think you should modify your ~`.sh` script~ code to also create `data/duke.txt` if it doesn't exist.

Edit: It should be done in the java code instead, you might also want to reset the file to blank state before each run of the test.

Hey, with `package duke / package duke.exceptions` as you've mentioned and your project structure, what worked for me was to mark `src/main/java` as your Sources Root directory. This way the packages are identified relative to it.

I agree with @woojiahao about ensuring that `Bar` is properly unit tested separately. One example I can think of is if `Bar` is a `String` so `fooMethod()` will return a `String`. It wouldn't make sense to test how the `String` is being created but rather just assume that its being created correctly. If theres anything wrong with the `String` class creation, it should be caught by the `String` classes unit tests (which i'm sure the people creating the standard Java library have done so).

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: What to do if increment requires multiple actions (e.g. branch-then-merge with tags) but was already completed previously**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/27" expanded>

I understand that if some increments have been implemented in prior weeks, we can either tag the relevant commit or latest commit with said increment. However, what if an increment requires more actions than just a commit tag?

---

For example, in my case, I wrote documentation as I code by habit. Hence, I might have no commits to do in `branch-A-JavaDoc`, nothing to tag `A-JavaDoc` to, etc. 

Suppose I still: 
- create the `branch-A-JavaDoc` branch anyway, 
- tag the top commit with `A-JavaDoc`, and 
- push it with no additional commits (so `master` and `branch-A-JavaDoc` are still pointing to the same commit).

Would that be okay for the auto-grader, or should I intentionally leave some docs out just so I can make a commit with the branch?

Similarly, does this apply to all future increments which may require multiple steps, but are inadvertently completed previously?

A situation where having a `Storage` class may help is if you plan to store other data files alongside your task list in the future (for example, user settings), and you want to ensure they are stored in a common system- or user-defined location.

Example: Data storage conventions are different across different OSes. For instance, these are possible conventions you might follow (may differ depending on environmental variables or OS versions):

- Windows: `~/AppData/Local/AppName/`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/AppName`
- Other Linux/Unix variants: `~/.config/AppName`

where `~` represents the home directory.

By having a separate `Storage` class, even if it is simply a wrapper on top of the built-in `File`, you can abstract away any operations dealing with the base directory. For instance, when providing a relative path to `Storage` to save a file to, it may auto-create a missing base directory behind the scenes, then auto-prepend the appropriate base directory to the provided relative path before saving.

With this separate wrapper class, any new files used by future features can easily share the same behaviour above.

I believe the reasons mentioned in 1 and 2 are actually two sides of the same coin. 

Notice `File` and other relevant Java classes themselves are also classes that:

1. require the user to continuously call it, and 
2. requires data passed to it to function. 

and hence technically exhibits the same problem you noted in reason 2. 

With that, since `Storage` is an intermediary of `File` operations (reason 1) it hence makes sense that it exhibits the same "dependency" on each other like `File` (reason 2). 

I feel these design concerns aren't really a big issue if even Java is organised this way.

---

Personally, I think whether you decouple TaskList and Storage is okay either way:

- **IO operations in Storage:** 
  - Since the provided `File` Java APIs also have ways to load and save with different formats via polymorphism, if the purpose of `Storage` is to be a higher-level IO wrapper for internal files, having said class could possibly help in code organisation and future convenience.
  - See also: Java's `BufferedReader`, which is designed to take in and wrap another reader such as `FileReader` for improved performance via buffering.

- **IO operations in TaskList**: 
  - Since it's only used in one place at the moment and we are focusing on iterating on the iP, calling Java File IO APIs within `TaskList` directly has no real downsides yet.

FYI to all, you may run any script automatically in your browser by simply getting a **userscript** browser extension (available on most browsers, e.g., [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo), [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/app/userscripts/id1463298887)), then creating your own userscript. For example, this is sufficient for me:

```js
// ==UserScript==
// @name        CS2103T Menu Autoexpander
// @description Automatically expands all collapsed menus on the CS2103T website.
// @match       *://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/website/*
// ==/UserScript==

const collapsibles = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.card-header'));
const uncollapsed = collapsibles.filter(node => {
    const glyph = node.querySelector('.glyphicon');
    if (!glyph) return false;
    return glyph.classList.contains('glyphicon-chevron-right');
});
uncollapsed.forEach(node => node.click());
```

You can do this for any other site as well! :)

I was wondering if it is possible to use the normal merge with fast forwarding if there is no merge conflicts for the adding of increments as parallel branch (the one after level 8) ? 

I understand that level 7 and 8 had explicit mention for it, but not for the level 9, coding standards and javadocs. 
I was testing out the preview pull request feature and merging on github directly, but I realised the merge request from github default global configuration for merge request is with fast forward ):

Hi I'm also facing this issue, however mine is due to a compatibility issue between the JDK and JavaFX.

## Reason for the error
Referencing [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67854139/javafx-warning-unsupported-javafx-configuration-classes-were-loaded-from-unna) does not seem to work for me. Just to clarify, for mac user, zulu jdk 11 and javaFX 17.0.7 and gradle 7.6.2 are used right?

Hi all, just wondering because there is a README.md file given in the repo which has some guide on how the format should look like. However when compared with the AB3 user guide given in the website (https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/UserGuide.html), the format seemed to be different. Hence I would like to know which format we should follow for this week's iP task.

The difference is that in the given README.md file, it is given to be describing the "Features" first then the "Usage" of the action to achieve this feature (the first picture) while the AB3 User's Guide kinda combine them both (the second picture)

Hi all I would like to clarify if the checking of the file/directory that we are supposed to save to should be done:
1. At the start of the program, if file/directory doesn't exist then exit the whole program
2. Keep the programming running while taking user input, if file/directory doesn't exist, user can choose to create it and do not have to exit the whole program

In my opinion, I think the 2nd option would be more intuitive and if deciding to go even more adventurous, the program can even create the directory and file for the user. Of course additional checks have to be done to ensure security and permission rights.

Hi prof, i did the checkout at each branch before my final implementation at Level 9 and realised that JUnit testing does work already. I'm quite confused though because at certain branches it doesn't work but as some it does. However it seems like there may be file changes that could cause it and my master branch is able to perform the JUnit testing already. Thank you!

Try modifying your `Duke` class such that it has an empty constructor. Perhaps your filePath string can be a constant.

You added the dependencies to Gradle, so it will only work when you run with Gradle.

It works because Duke works with an empty constructor not so much because the filepath is a constant. The `Application.launch` takes in a class which extends the `Application` class. The `Application` class should have an empty constructor.

Hope it helps! 😸

Just like everything in software engineering, I believe there are tradeoffs to making your code "more OOP". OOP definitely brings a lot of benefits in terms of modularization and flexibility of your code.

However, I do think it does comes at the expense of moving quickly. You will often find yourself going back to old code that is working but needing to refactor them to make it follow OOP. So, it does come with some overhead.

Nevertheless, I believe as software engineers, our job is to be able to discern that and balance what is the right amount of "division" is needed.

Just my opinion! 😸

Your `build.gradle` settings should target your `Launcher` class instead of your regular `Duke` class. You can do this by changing the `application` field in `build.gradle` to this:

```java
application {
    mainClass.set("duke.Launcher")
}
``` 

Do also make sure there is only one `application` field in the file because I noticed you specified it twice.

In order to build using Gradle, the project is configured based on your system's version of Java, not the project's. You need to verify that your system is running the correct version of Java too. You can check your system's version of Java using this command:
```shell
java -version
``` 

You should see something like this:
```shell
openjdk version "11.0.20" 2023-07-18 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu11.66+15-CA (build 11.0.20+8-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu11.66+15-CA (build 11.0.20+8-LTS, mixed mode)
```

Check the build version of Java, make sure it includes support for JavaFX. You can refer to the course website for more info. https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/website/admin/programmingLanguages.html

I think for this situation, just add a comment near the change or add documentation near the change, like for gradle, add a comment in the gradle file or even in the Duke file, just signalling that its a dummy commit and you've carried out the increment in a previous commit so you have some proof when it comes to grading. Shouldn't be an issue as pointed out by prof above but if you're apprehensive haha. And add a tag to the dummy commit, so the code gets recorded.

I appreciate the thoughtful discussion on whether to have a separate Storage class in our project. I'd like to share some strengths and advantages of having a dedicated Storage class, despite the tight coupling with TaskList that we've observed:

1. Isolation of Saving/Writing Operations:

One of the key benefits of introducing a Storage class is that it provides a clear separation of concerns. It isolates the task of saving and writing data from the rest of the application logic. This separation makes our codebase more maintainable and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), a fundamental principle in software design.
By encapsulating file I/O operations within the Storage class, we reduce the risk of scattering file-related code throughout the TaskList class. This isolation can help us manage and debug these operations more effectively.

2. Error Handling and Abstraction:

Another advantage of having a Storage class is the opportunity it provides for centralized error handling and abstraction. We can implement error-checking and exception handling in one place within the Storage class, ensuring that any issues related to data storage are handled consistently.
Furthermore, as pointed out by another participant. if we decide to support different data storage formats or locations in the future, the Storage class can serve as an abstraction layer. This allows us to change the underlying storage mechanisms without affecting the TaskList class or other parts of our application. It promotes flexibility and future-proofing.

3. Code Organization and Readability:

From a code organization perspective, having a Storage class can improve the overall readability of our code. It abstracts away low-level file operations and provides a more human-readable interface for saving and loading data. This can make the code within the TaskList class cleaner and easier to understand. 

4. Potential for Future Features:

While our project may not currently have additional data storage needs beyond the TaskList, designing a Storage class can set a foundation for future features. If we ever need to manage other data files alongside the task list, having a dedicated Storage class will make it easier to extend our codebase without introducing unnecessary complexity. Also helps to facilitate reading of same file to multiple task lists and vice versa, helping with versions of files and tasks list.

I understand that when we create unit tests for a particular method, we should isolate the method from its dependencies. However, how about the following case:

Here, it seems that it is impossible to isolate `fooMethod` from the `Bar` class as it is supposed to return it. In such cases, can we assume that it is okay not to isolate the two? If so, then wouldn't `fooMethod` depend on the constructor of `Bar` not being buggy? Apologies if this question seems a little silly 😆

Is there any way I can rectify this? I'm hesitant to merge the old branch-level-8 with my current master branch as I don't want my code to be messed up, is there any safe way to do so without the merge commit affecting my current code base?

On macOS, JDK versions are permanently installed in /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines. You need to `cd` into that directory and `sudo rm -rf` that particular version of Java. The Application Support directory contains Java itself (the Application to support the running of Java apps on macOS), which (iirc) is different from JDK (the Java Development Kit used to compile and run Java code).

The instructions [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jdk.html) are clearer.

@lunaroddity I can't tell from your screenshots, but if you entered the command "bye", and only then received the build success message, then that means the gradle run was successful. However, if the program exited immediately, then that might be an issue, as in my case the program only indicated the success message after I input the "bye" command. In fact, the program ran normally for every command until I input the "bye" command.

I tried to create the GitHub organisation for my team, but because my internet was facing issues, I decided to let my team mate do it instead. I deleted my team organisation and now am unable to use the organisation name for 90 days. Can I ask how my team should go about with naming the organisation? Currently we are thinking of creating an organisation with a separate name, and will rename it according to how we should when we can. Thank you.

For the first, the coding standard states:
```
Constant names must be all uppercase using underscore to separate words.
```
I believe that constant means it has to be a static variable. Otherwise, for every instance of the class, I can have a different value of that variable. Hence, we use camelCase in this case.
For the second, it states:
```
Plural form should be used on names representing a collection of objects.
```
Hence, I think we should use ```tasks``` as the name instead. However, if there is a case where ```taskList``` is needed for some reason, we notice the following below the standard:
```
Rationale: Enhances readability since the name gives the user an immediate clue of the type of the variable and the operations that can be performed on its elements. One space character after the variable type is enough to obtain clarity.
```
Hence, I think it is okay to leave it in singular form as it hints to people that it is only one list.

The guide for Gradle states that within `build.gradle` it states that `archiveBaseName = &gt;botname>.jar`, as seen at the bottom of the first image, but after running `./gradlew shadowJar`, I got the below result, notably `cheese.jar.jar`

I understand that I could just change `archiveBaseName = &gt;botname>.jar` to `archiveBaseName = &gt;botname>` to get `&gt;botname>.jar`, that is why it is a pedantic question. My question is do I follow the guide here? Or should I not  follow the guide and edit the archiveBaseName?

git tag [new_tag_name] [old_tag_name]

Perhaps you might want to try gradlew build, then close IntelliJ and reopen it.

Otherwise, I think a brute force way would be to 
Delete the `.gradle` folder in your project and in your users folder (e.g.,: `C:\users\&gt;username>\.gradle`)
Afterwards rebuild gradle using gradlew build
This will force Gradle to download the packages all over again and could solve the problem
However, don't delete the `gradle` folder in the repo.

The creation of 2 jar files is because you specified the `dependsOn("distZip", "distTar")` in the configuration. So when shadowJar is run, it'll execute these tasks resulting in the creation of the additional ip.jar file.

If you dont need the distribution archives, you can remove the `dependsOn("distZip", "distTar")` line from the configuration and it should only generate the `duke.jar` file.

> Try "Level-x" with uppercase "L" instead of lowercase in your tag name?

Alright, I may or may not have pushed the tags onto the fork 5 days ago, I have just pushed the tags today and I'll check in again tomorrow morning to see if the issue persists.

You currently have your image extensions as .png in MainWindow whereas your resources are in jpg format.
```Java
    private Image userImage = new Image(this.getClass().getResourceAsStream("/images/DaUser.png"));
    private Image dukeImage = new Image(this.getClass().getResourceAsStream("/images/DaDuke.png"));
```
Additionally, after fixing that error you might need to add the FXML annotation to the DialogBox class, as I ran into another error without those tags.

About the JavaFX warning, I get it too. My SceneBuilder app seems to save FXMLs in V20.0.1 even if I manually change the version in the raw file and reload. For me, my warning says my JavaFX runtime is `17-internal`. I hope it will be fine. I [searched it up a bit](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65991076/11536796), so maybe I can look into that for the TP.

Hi, just a quick question on these two types of variables and how we should declare them in naming. I'm aware that coding standards are just a standard, and they can be changed, just wondering which of the two options we should adhere to or if both are OK.

1. for e.g. a storage class linked to a bot, that is intended to be paired permanently with the bot:
```java
private final Storage ______ = new Storage();
```
what should we put in the space? uppercase STORAGE_FILE (Since it's declared as final) or camelcase storageFile (Since it's mutable)?

2. next, for a variable aggregator such as an arraylist holding multiple objects:
```java
private ArrayList<Task> ______ = new ArrayList<>();
```
I'm aware that the convention recommends a name like listOfTasks; but what if we refer to the arraylist as a single object, like taskHolder or taskList? is that acceptable within the standard of this course?

thanks for the clarification!

Hi guys, update: I found a google style guide [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s5.2.4-constant-names) that states mutable static final objects should **NOT** be written in uppercase, since they don't adhere to what a constant is. Should we adhere to this standard?

hi Jason,
I noticed some changes in the way you wrote your handleInput function. I agree that the splitting of commands into functions would help with structure. 
While the code is much better now, I have a few nits. Given that a majority of code deals with TaskList, perhaps it should be a member variable instead of a function argument?
Overall, good work so far.

Hi @kiwibang, could you share more on how you managed to get the project structure?
I originally installed Java11 using sdkman, but have tried uninstalling and installing from Azul directly but to no avail.

I used the first method to set up JavaFX, but could only load up distributions for MacOs as well.

> Could you try installing a mix of dependencies (keeping the OS distributions for Linux and Windows, but reverting the dependenices for Mac ARM64). I suspect the ARM64 dependency for Mac differs from the general Mac distribution.

I have also tried this set of dependencies, but the project structure came up empty.

Check that in your build.gradle you have

```groovy
application {
    mainClass.set("duke.main.Launcher")
}
```

I'm not entirely sure, but I'm guessing your mainClass is currently set to `duke.main.Main` or `duke.main.Duke` and some code is calling `new Main()` somewhere causing the error you're seeing.

In the [Conventional Commits format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), the subject line would be prefixed with a type, such as `feat` or `fix`, which is in lowercase. This conflicts with the [course's Git conventions](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html), which require the first letter of the subject line to be capitalized.

Are we allowed to use the Conventional Commits format? 

Example: `feat: Add save/load functionality`

Or should we follow the course's Git conventions strictly, and use the following instead?

Or are we not allowed to use Conventional Commits at all?

In your commit [eb7ee36e19a68ee666531b5ff0a7246361f19ee0](https://github.com/AlainS87/ip/commit/eb7ee36e19a68ee666531b5ff0a7246361f19ee0), I noticed you moved your files out of the `src/main/java/` folder. I think that you should try putting your `alain` package in the `src/main/java/` folder.

The structure should look something like this:
```
ip
├── src
│   └── main
│       └── java
│           └── alain
│               ├── AlainException.java

│               ├── ToDos.java
│               └── Ui.java
```

Then change the `application` field in `build.gradle` to:
```
application {
    mainClass.set("alain.ChatbotAlain")
}
```

Hi, I've tested out the jar and it works on mac! Just that since it's from an unidentified developer, they would need to Ctrl+click the file and select open in order to be able to open it.

I currently have a field that is

Hihi, i think a while back, I tried to help one of my friends  test his ip. (I was running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on my desktop) and I could not get it to fully work(it still kinda ran). Maybe you could try to install a different jdk version on your linux machine ?

I personally think creating two different classes for list of tasks and storage is not necessary. The reason for which is as follows:
1. One cannot exist without the other. TaskList will be stored using Storage and Storage serves only as an intermediary between file storage and TaskList; a task already achieved by `IO::File` class.
2. One cannot operate without the other. TaskList's method is continuously calling Storage's method and Storage's method needs TaskList's data passed to it to operate.
3. Neither is used by other feature. At least as of right now, neither TaskList nor Storage is used by any other class and it is hard for me to see in which scenario this won't be the case.

As such, we've created a scenario where we try to separate two tightly coupled systems to achieve what could be done better (in terms of performance, ease of development, and design) by simply implementing additional methods. In case I missed anything, I would love to hear more reason as to why creating the Storage class is actually necessary. Thank you

Hm I see what you mean, thanks for the response. Elaborating on your case, however, unless we want to impose an implicit rule on how the data is formatted for every kind of data (which we don't), we need to basically create an interface with "save" and "load" method that will be implemented differently for each data format. Then we proceed by creating a `TaskStorage implements Storage` class which will be tightly coupled with our `TaskList` class.

While I understand that this is preferable in projects that have multiple features with other data files, I think creating a `Storage` as a class (and not interface) for our project is rather useless; it doesn't solve the problem you mentioned and at least the first two issues I brought up with this design still persist.

When using String.format(), it is natural to use magic literals. For example: 

`String.format("You used \"%s\" as an argument. A bye command shouldn't have any arguments", desc)`

Is this an acceptable piece of code or is String.format() is not a good method to use?

Ah yes, I believe that using constants on String.format() will really only obscure readability. I suppose the real question we should be asking is: how far is too far when enforcing the no magic literals rule?

You should put Duke.java into duke package but not inside other sub packages.
For me I have: duke.command(Command-related classes), duke.task(Task-related classes, including the various types of tasks), duke.storage(Classes related to file storage), duke.ui( User interface classes), duke(Core classes and exceptions).

The issue arises because the FileWriter essentially truncates the file when it is opened for writing. This means that the contents of the file are erased, and the file becomes empty. As a result, when you subsequently call setup.hasNext() right after creating the FileWriter, it returns false because there are no more tokens to read – the file is empty.

In addition, if you want to tag a specific commit without a tag that is not the most recent one (and hence renaming is impossible), you can do the following
### Step 1: Find the commit
Run `git log` and use the vim motion keys `j` and `k` to find the specific commit. Copy the commit's hash (the long string of hexadecimal after the word `commit`) and press `q` to quit.
### Step 2: Add the tag
```
git tag [tag_name] [commit_hash]
```
Confusingly, this has the same syntax as renaming the tag as mentioned above.
### Step 3: Update the remote repository
```
git push origin --tags
```

solution is to not use the checkstyle by gradle but instead use intelj checkstyle which you can view on week 4 checkstyle assignment

try using this, first use checkstyle on i intelj instead of gradle, it can be done in 5 mins follow the week 4 project 
next change your dependancies to this

It could be because in your duke constructor your calling a method to wait for user response. Hence the programme is stuck waiting for user response and the javafx cant run its method. This is why when u use the bye command the gui appears. Just comment out the part of the constructor where you poll for user response

Hey guys I've been stuck with this error for really long and can't make progress

This is my project structure below. I keep getting constant errors saying that the packages don't exist. I'm very sure I included the package duke / package duke.exceptions declaration at the top of every file. I believe I'm also importing correctly. The javac directory is my source root and I have 3 packages: duke, duke.exceptions and duke.tasks. Would appreciate any help.

I agree with WangCheng. Would also like to add on that this is good just in case there are erroneous inputs that you forget to handle (e.g. user typing in mark 9 when there are less than 9 tasks, can result in the program breaking due to IndexOutOfBounds error)

Hi, from my experience, sometimes you need to wait for a while for the codecov page to update. Another thing you can try is to push a commit to your fork (e.g. ammend the README file) and create a pull request. This will prompt codecov to run and if you can see the codecov checks below the build checks like:

Then you're probably doing it right

I have followed the instructions given on the [website](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html#configuring-checkstyle), added the config files from address book and added the necessary changes to my build.gradle file. However, when running gradlew checkstyleMain, it failed with the following error message:

I have added this into my build.gradle file: 
  
```
plugins {

checkstyle {

May I ask what could possibly go wrong?

In week 2, it is specified on the website, "From this point onward, commit code at important points. Minimally, commit after completing each increment". Not sure if this will affect grades. Actually, I think we are supposed to separate each increment into different branches. According to your description, it seems like you are implementing it on the master branch only.

@lunaroddity The reason is because your program is not exiting properly and the scanner is still trying to get input. Try giving the bye command and you will notice that the program does not actually exit. Try using `instanceof` to check for exit condition in your `run` loop:
```java
if (cmd instanceof ByeCommand) {
    isExit = true;
 }
```

Currently facing a similar error, not sure how to solve also. May i ask if you are using a Macbook as well? Seems like the way JavaFx is compiled is with the x86_64, while i'm running on an ARM64 architecture.

A strange thing that occurs on my end however, is that suppose you simply ran gradle clean build, then directly access the shadow jar file using java -jar, it still works fine. Therefore it is only when running using gradle, that was the issue.

Hi Jason, honestly I think you can consider using regular expression to parse some of your things. As they can be quite flexible in reducing some of the checks that you might need compared to if you are parsing the entire String by itself. Hope this helps.

tested your first code and it works, resulting in an infinite loop. maybe you could provide more details on what you included in your loop, or even your text file. next() and nextline() will progress the scanner, so maybe that's why your hasnext() is becoming false. hope this helps!

Yes, because the Scene builder is v20, once you update the FXML file using Scene builder, the FXML file will use javafx v20. 

I think there are two ways to solve this
1. Use scene builder v17 instead

or

2.  In you fxml files, after you are done with editing using scene builder, manually update the value of the `xmlns` attribute of the 1st XML opening tag.

For example, changing

`&gt;fx:root alignment="TOP_RIGHT" maxHeight="1.7976931348623157E308" prefWidth="400.0" type="javafx.scene.layout.HBox" xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/20" xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1">`

to 

`&gt;fx:root alignment="TOP_RIGHT" maxHeight="1.7976931348623157E308" prefWidth="400.0" type="javafx.scene.layout.HBox" xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/17" xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1">`

in the relevant xml files will make the warning go away. 

Note that if use method 2, you will have to update that everytime you change any files using Scene builder.

Hi @TiwKangXu ,

This is what I have gathered from my experience and from web resources such as StackOverflow based on the information provided in the issue that you have raised.

The error is likely occurring because of a discrepancy in the package name used in the mainClass configuration in your build.gradle file and the actual package name in your code. You may try to go through the following steps to fix the problem:

Update build.gradle:
In your build.gradle file, make sure that you have the correct package name set for the mainClass configuration. Since you mentioned that you changed it to duke.Duke (line 31 in build.gradle), make sure it matches the package name of your Duke.java class.

My file structure is as follows: src > java > main > geraldbot > Duke.java. The following is the way that I have configured my mainClass in build.gradle:

application {
    mainClassName("geraldbot/Duke")
}

Rebuild JAR:
After making sure that the package names are consistent, rebuild the JAR using Gradle to ensure the changes are reflected in the JAR file.  Afterwards, run the jar file to ensure that the JAR is built correctly with the updated package configuration.

After carrying out these steps, open Duke.java in IntelliJ and run it. Since you've updated the package name in both the build.gradle configuration and the source code, you should no longer encounter the LinkageError when running the program within the IDE. Hope this helps.

## Verify your SSH keys

Did you create an SSH keypair on your system? If you didn't, perhaps in week 2 you used the HTTPS URL i.e. https://... instead of the SSH URL to fetch from GitHub, and perhaps you might want to revert to that i.e. `git remote set-url origin &gt;http url>`.

Otherwise, can you check that your SSH keys exist and haven't changed. If you aren't sure where it is and didn't do any special configuration other than googling "how to create SSH key", you can usually find your key-pair at `~/.ssh`.

Run `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and check that there's some output that starts with `ssh-rsa`. **Do not `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa` (notice there's no .pub file extension here) and never send the output from that anywhere.**

## Check your SSH keys on GitHub

Go to the SSH keys configuration page at https://github.com/settings/keys and check that there's at least one SSH key listed there. Ensure that your SSH key output from before (the `id_rsa.pub` file) matches the SSH key listed there. If it doesn't, create a new entry and add the output from before there.

**Again, do not do not do not copy and paste the output from `id_rsa`, copy the output from `id_rsa.pub`.**

As @jiakai-17 has mentioned, you should place your package in the `src/main/java/` folder, Gradle's Java plugin assumes that your code will be in that directory, unless set otherwise.

Yep, following what Keagan said with reference to the course website link he provided, perhaps you could try using the Azul jdk 11.0.20 version from [here](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-11-lts&os=macos&architecture=arm-64-bit&package=jdk-fx#zulu) instead of the jdk 11.0.17 version (as configured in your IntelliJ project SDK). Hope this helps!

Make sure you set the correct main class in the build.gradle file. Initially had the same issue, but could be solved by setting the main class as the app entry point which calls the fx dependencies in your code (eg Launcher.java). Hope this helps :)

Changing the type of the text from **Label** to **Text** worked for me.

From some online posts, these two types are different because **Label** is a *Control*, whereas **Text** is a *Shape*. I'm not entirely sure why **Label** will be automatically truncated. My interpretation is that, the properties of a **Label** are binded to its parent and siblings, thus may be affected by other controls in the environment. However the dimensions of a **Text** are fixed once it is created. Maybe someone who can explain more accurately can help chime in here.

**Text** does not have some of the customisable properties of **Label**. I replaced those properties with **wrappingWidth** and **textAlignment** to make sure it looks the same as before.

I faced a similar issue when I tried to distribute my Jar file to a friend using Mac (built on Windows, but unable to run on mac). I believe the issue is with the version of the javafx gradle plugin as brought up by in the Openjfx forum [here](https://github.com/openjfx/javafx-gradle-plugin/issues/112). It seems like the issue with the Gradle plugin was fixed in openjfx version 0.0.13, maybe we could have a hotfix after verifying that is the issue.

For now, I tweaked my build.gradle dependencies to declare the `mac-aarch64` architecture and it was able to run on my friend's mac. You can try this and let us know how it goes!

```

Following the [JavaFx tutorial guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFxPart1.html), after copying the `start` method into your Duke.java file, 

```java
@Override
    public void start(Stage stage) {

        Scene scene = new Scene(helloWorld); // Setting the scene to be our Label

        stage.setScene(scene); // Setting the stage to show our screen
        stage.show(); // Render the stage.
    }
```

you may encounter the following error when you attempt to run the application:

### Fix 

You will have to create an overloaded constructor that takes in **no** parameters.

>Calling Application.launch(...) causes an instance of your Application subclass to be created, the FX Application toolkit to be started, and start() to be invoked on the created instance.
>
>--<cite>source: [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37634688/cant-run-my-javafx-program-caused-by-java-lang-runtimeexception)


The Application instance is created by calling the no-argument constructor, so the Application subclass, `Duke`, needs to define one:

E.g. if your `Duke` constructor looks something like this:

```java
public Duke(String filePath) {
    // code here
}
```

add an overloaded public constructor that takes in no parameters:

```java
public Duke() {
    this(DEFAULT_FILE_PATH);
}
```

Hope this helps!

Hello prof and friends, When I see GUI I interpret it as a graphical interface in the sense that users can call the commands by interacting with the UI like how we would do with normal applications, which is why I created my program to be something like this (delete, add, mark, unmark, task type) are all selected through a user interface.

But after looking through the other people's screenshots, I realized GUI would retain the same functionalities (all the commands are accessed through the command line, in this case the user input field), just that we have a graphical representation of it in the form of a chatbot.

Will mine fulfill the requirement or do I need to redo it?

With reference to the image above, it seems that Person has a role "app" containing an object Main, wouldn't this imply that we are able to access that attribute to Main within a Person object. Hence navigate from Person to Main?

Hello everyone, 

I recently completed iP and successfully generated a JAR file that works fine on my MacBook, as well as some of my friend's MacBook.

Not sure if you have found the solution, but I will share my approach to this issue here:

```java
// A simplified section from my code

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;

public class CommandTest {

    @Test
    public void taskList_inputLessThanOne_exceptionThrown() {
        try {
            Command command = new MarkCommand("0");
            command.execute(taskList, ui, storage);
            Assertions.fail();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Assertions.assertEquals("The task index cannot be less than 1", e.getMessage());
        }

    }

}
```

Since they are static functions, you can just call them from the Assertions class, e.g. Assertions.assertEquals() instead of assertEquals().
