<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: Resolving JavaFX Cross-Platform Issues with Gradle JavaFX Plugin**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/173" expanded>

## Preface

There has been several issues open about not being able to run the JAR cross-platform for various reasons, most occurring because the Gradle setup for JavaFX was using the following:

```groovy
plugins {
    // ...
    id 'checkstyle'
    id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.0.13'
}

javafx {
    version = '17.0.7'
    modules = ['javafx.base', 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml', 'javafx.graphics']
}
```

The error is a `QuantumReader` error.

## Solution

I was digging through the official OpenJFX documentation to find a potential fix that continued using the (formerly) second method of importing JavaFX in Gradle:

![Screenshot 2023-09-22 at 09 48 38](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/29497029/52c6a140-9774-4cb6-adbf-34c001bd7f6e)

This is my `build.gradle` now. I've tested out the JAR on a Windows ARM build emulated on Mac M1 Pro machine:

```gradle
plugins {
    // ...
    id 'checkstyle'
    id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.0.13'
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.10.0'
    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.10.0'
    implementation group: 'com.google.code.gson', name: 'gson', version: '2.10.1'

    // Used for loops to clean up the imports
    def platforms = ["win", "linux", "mac"]
    def javafxDependency = ["javafx-graphics", "javafx-controls", "javafx-fxml"]

    for (plt in platforms) {
        for (dep in javafxDependency) {
            runtimeOnly "org.openjfx:$dep:$javafx.version:$plt"
        }
    }
}


// ...

javafx {
    version = '17.0.7'
    modules = ['javafx.base', 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml', 'javafx.graphics']
}
```

I am currently setting up VMs (both emulated and virtualized) on a Macbook Pro 14 (M1 Pro) to test various platforms. Would be great if others could try this fix too and see if it resolves their cross-platform issue.

|OS|Architecture|Works?|
|--|------------|------|
|MacOS|ARM (M1 Pro)| ✅ |
|Windows|ARM (Virtualized)| ✅ |
|Windows|x86 (Live Machine)| ✅ |
|Linux|x86 (Ubuntu Live Machine)| ✅ |

Note: I still have the Gradle checkstyle plugin so there is no need to delete it when using this method

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: Auto-expanding all collapsed windows💡**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/103" expanded>

I've noticed that even in the textbook, there are sections in Week 4's slides that are collapsed. So I wrote a quick script in JS to auto-expand all of these sections so it's much easier to search for content:

```js
const collapsibles = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.card-header'))
const uncollapsed = collapsibles.filter(node => {
    const glyph = node.querySelector('.glyphicon')
    if (!glyph) return false;
    return glyph.classList.contains('glyphicon-chevron-right')
})
uncollapsed.forEach(node => node.click())
```

To run it, just open the developer console in the page in question and paste in the script into the console and run it

(Noticed that previous semesters have had similar scripts too)

Hope this helps someone! :)

Usually you would create packages under `src/main/java` instead, not as separate packages under `src`. Inspired by the Maven repository structure which I believe Gradle follows as well: https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html

Both Maven and Gradle are package management tools for Java, similar to `npm` in Javascript or Cargo in Rust

It's likely something to do with redirection relying on a single `System.in`: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27286690/in-java-is-it-possible-to-re-open-system-in-after-closing-it

When reading input from the redirected file, the first Scanner closes `System.in` and so resulting uses of `System.in` will fail. This doesn't occur in manual input since `System.in` is available for each new line you enter

    while (true) {
      Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
      String input;
      input = sc.nextLine();
      System.out.println(input);
      if (input.equals("bye")) {
        break;
      }
    }

    System.out.println("Outside");

You need `git push --tags` otherwise your tag will not be published

`git tag` alone will only add a tag locally, your remote repository does not contain the tag

I would also add that it's best if you don't try to think of commands as a sequence to memorise but rather as a set of tasks that need to be done, this way it's easier to handle issues like merge conflicts or multiple branches:

1. `git add &gt;file>`: stage the file for the next "snapshot"/commit
2. `git commit -m`: create the "snapshot"/commit with a message
3. `git tag`: provide the current "snapshot"/commit with a human readable tag name
4. `git push`: bring changes from local repository to remote repository, does not include tags
5. `git push --tags`: bring all local tags to remote repository

This way, it's much easier when dealing with larger commits/projects, hope this helps

This seems like a slightly more volatile client-side issue. If there's no guarantee that you are able to assure that all clients can easily view the unicode (and there's no easy way for them to remedy this) why not use `X` instead?

> a solution to set the default encoding when compiling/running the java program using gradle will be required

I'm not entirely sure if this is even possible to dictate for your users through Gradle 🤔 . Once the program is running, your user's terminal encoding is the one that dictates what characters show up.

One really hack-y way is to forcefully set your user's terminal encoding by directly running commands when your bot starts such as using `Runtime.exec()` (https://www.baeldung.com/run-shell-command-in-java). You could try playing around with the `LC_ALL` of the user's configuration to see if that ensures "global" viewing but as pointed out in [this article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36184019/is-it-possible-force-utf-8-in-a-c-program), doing this could be a very slippery slope as the user's encoding affects things outside of just displaying the symbols

For Unix systems, `LC_ALL` seems to be sufficient but for Windows, you might need to try this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35549962/lc-all-c-equivalent-for-windows-using-powershell

Just recompile the files with Java 11 and they'll be "Java 11". You don't have to downgrade your Java version. `jenv` is a way to manage multiple Java installations (if you're on MacOS): https://www.jenv.be/

If you're on Windows, believe you can just install Java 11 and point the path variable to the Java 11 installation instead (but I've not used Windows in quite a while so any Windows folks, feel free to correct me)

Usually, I would always put my entry point class outside of all other subpackages at the root of my folder so the structure is like this:

```
src/main/java/duke
    utility/
    commands/
    Duke.java

To me this makes the most sense since the entry point does not belong in any subpackage

To follow up on this, this section of ShadowJar's docs is probably relevant: https://imperceptiblethoughts.com/shadow/configuration/#configuring-output-name

For `archiveJarName`, it's a Gradle attribute so you can refer to [the website](https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Jar.html):

I think the main idea is to have a **logical separation** of concerns and to not create new classes for the sake of creating a class. This goes back to what the problem is. Let's say you are trying to implement a builder pattern, out of necessity, a secondary (usually nested) `Builder` class is needed. This is a logical separation of work since you need this `Builder` class for you to be able to properly implement the pattern. An instance where creating a class for the sake of creating a class is going to be redundant is in cases where you have a single utility method used in a single location but you try abstracting it out into a "utility" class just because you can. In those scenarios, I would just leave the utility method in the class it is used since it's not going to ever be used outside.

Besides the "need" concern, I think a bigger component of modularity is the ability to have finer unit testing. Larger modules/classes imply that you have a lot more surface area to cover for a unit test. This is not a bad thing per-se but being able to modularize the code means that you decouple long dependency chains so that each unit test covers exactly one component and does not have to overextend its testing. One very good example is the `Parser` class in iP where having a separate class means you can individually test `parse()` without having to worry about setting up the file storage or making sure the bot is running.

For most web frameworks (think Gin for Go, Spring Boot for Java, Phoenix for Elixir), it is not uncommon to see a high level of modularity when building out a single endpoint. Usually you have a router to handle the web routes, then you have a controller to handle the HTTP request, and then a set of models that the controller uses, and finally a data layer that connects with the database. This modularity, while verbose and tedious at times, gives a very clear flow of what goes where and the roles each class/module plays. Even in desktop applications, you might see architectures like the Model-View-Controller (MVC) where you already have three layers of modularity.

Tl;dr: dividing into multiple classes is a double edged sword, it gives clear visibility and responsibility to each file which makes testing a lot easier but overdoing it because you can is bound to make the code more unreadable and harder to navigate

I've forked your repository and managed to rectify the issue. The primary issue is the use of `Pane` to wrap your dialog messages (for some odd reason, it does not allow the wrap text to work as expected). You can use `HBox` to arrange the content already. You also need to configure the parent container (`VBox` in `ScrollPane`) to have a fixed width too. I've updated the view through FXML directly so I removed the `children` nodes but the general logic applies. You might want to re-adjust some of the values I hardcoded to suit your needs but believe it's best to show what changes were needed:

To give some more context for future reference (and those who encounter similar issue). The fixes that I applied are as such:

1. Remove the use of Pane since `HBox` already handles alignment of content
2. Remove the `prefHeight` attribute of the `VBox` inside `ScrollPane` since that would cause scrolling issues with longer texts from my experience
3. Set the `prefWidth` of the `Label` directly so that there is a specified container size
4. Set the background styling directly onto the `Label`, not the `Pane`

I generally try to think of FXML + CSS in terms of HTML flexbox so that helps with understanding the way to layout content

Could I ask why you want to compile the files? 

Once you start importing public libraries, it becomes increasingly more challenging to manually compile the code. You do not need to manually compile your Java code with Gradle since it does it for you. That's the whole purpose of using a package management tool instead of manually downloading and managing your dependencies (see CMake and C++ for why this is tedious and painful)

The reason this is failing is because Gradle downloaded the dependencies from the internet and you are not including them when you compile your programs

Edit: manually compiling all the JavaFX dependencies would mean downloading the JAR files and using the following command: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9395207/how-to-include-jar-files-with-java-file-and-compile-in-command-prompt

The `.idea/` folder is ignored by `.gitignore`. Also, I don't seem to see a `config/checkstyle/configuration.xml` in your project root. The instructions from the notes should be done sequentially, so once you setup the `configuration.xml`, then you can add it to the Intellij project

I personally do not see an alternative to testing it as is. I view unit testing practices as guidelines that should be done when possible. In this scenario, if you are worried about the reliability of returning the instance `Bar`, then the thing you should focus on is not the fact that there is a dependency, but rather, making sure that `Bar` is properly unit tested separately. This way, you are "guaranteed" that `fooMethod` would not be buggy.

The key here is to make sure `Bar` is independently tested (or as much as it can be) and that way, you are sure there is no issues returning a new instance of it from `Foo`. You shouldn't need to test the `Bar` object returned from `fooMethod` inside `Foo` since then you would have overlapping unit tests. So there's two separate test files, `BarTest` and `FooTest` and you don't mix the unit tests

That's my take on this

I think this really boils down to what is defined as a magic literal. An interesting paper I found was this: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584922000908

And it defines magic literals as 

> Magic literals are such values used without an explicit explanation of their meaning.

So the key component to what makes magic literals magic is the fact that there is a lack of **explicit** explanation of their meaning. In the case of 'String.format()', the strings that you use are self-explanatory, they are simply the contents to print and the interpolated variables should be explained in their own ways. So I don't think that this is a magic literal and it does not affect the readability of the code.

As for whether it is alright to use magic strings, I see this as being a similar problem to writing SQL code in another language. For instance, is it better to include the SQL query directly like (using Go to illustrate but the idea applies):

'''go
db.Query('
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE username = $1
', username)
'''

Or if it's better to abstract this query into a separate string such as:

'''go
const QUERY = '
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE username = $1
'

db.Query(QUERY, username)
'''

I think in this case, having an extra layer of abstraction might actually make it harder to understand the intent of the code and make it harder to trace. You could imagine the 'QUERY' being stored in a separate file so you will have to jump between files to figure out these magic literals. I think the SQL string is self-explanatory, albeit slightly long but it doesn't really violate SLAP since it's still along the same level of abstraction.

This is just my take on this though, would love to hear what others think!

> Moving it to one location as a NAMED_CONSTANT can make future updates to it easier and less error-prone.

I agree, however, I might argue that if it's used in `String.format()`, it's unlikely to be reused so moving it to another location could be considered as a premature optimisation that might not be necessary. I think this really boils down to the context and use case of the literal.

This is my `build.gradle` now. I've tested out the JAR on a Windows ARM build emulated on Mac M1 Pro machine:

```gradle
dependencies {
    testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.10.0'
    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.10.0'
    implementation group: 'com.google.code.gson', name: 'gson', version: '2.10.1'

    // Used for loops to clean up the imports
    def platforms = ["win", "linux", "mac"]
    def javafxDependency = ["javafx-graphics", "javafx-controls", "javafx-fxml"]

    for (plt in platforms) {
        for (dep in javafxDependency) {
            runtimeOnly "org.openjfx:$dep:$javafx.version:$plt"
        }
    }
}


// ...

javafx {
    version = '17.0.7'
    modules = ['javafx.base', 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml', 'javafx.graphics']
}
```

Would be great if others could help perform a quick smoke test on native Windows machines. Perhaps this was the fix missing for the second method of setting up JavaFX:

|OS|Architecture|Works?|
|--|------------|------|
|MacOS|ARM (M1 Pro)| ✅ |
|Windows|ARM (Emulated)| ✅ |

The JAR file is still on Java version 13. I just tested it on my machine too. Could you try re-building the JAR via Intellij's Gradle task manager instead?

Think there's some missing context, like what is "building the `shadowJar`? Are you referring to using Intellij's built-in JARing? If so, then it's not working because it does not build a fat JAR that contains all the dependencies like JavaFX and JUnit. ShadowJAR resolves this by handling it for you when you run `./gradlew shadowJar`.

You might want to read up more about what fat JARs are and the types of JARs you can get:

- https://imperceptiblethoughts.com/shadow/introduction/

Further clarification: Intellij's built-in JARing functionality is not the same as ShadowJAR, so using Intellij's JARing does not immediately guarantee that you are building a fat JAR

The beauty of Git and version control is that you get to work asynchronously and sync your work anytime in the flow (but before you push to `master`). Generally, if the upstream `master` is updated, you could merge the latest changes into your branch using:

```
git fetch upstream master
git merge upstream/master
```

Run on your local branch, before anymore dev work. But fret not if you did not do so, you can do it after you've finished your changes, or through Github's PR UI that will also prompt you to merge to `master` to remain latest before you can merge your PR :)

During the merging process, I believe I should have tagged and pushed the commit after every successfuly merge conflict handling. However, I have just finished everything and then pushed the master branch and the three parallel branches when I realised this problem.

How should I approach this? Is it okay to tag this current commit (done with all the merge) three times with three different tags?

I have a method handleInput() that takes in the parsed user input to output corresponding text, based on the first word of the input (commands). But there's a lot of commands possible, so my handleInput() function spans around 100 lines of code (due to all the if else conditions)

Is this still within the limits? if not, then where should the helper methods be created? in the Ui class or the Parser class?

It all depends on how flexibility. Creating more classes doesn't imply better OOP, in my humble opinion. But wisely creating classes, then yes, better OOP indeed.

It seems that you are just trying to test a constructor, instead of testing whether the instance created fulfills any requirements. Test cases like this can only have bugs when Bar is an abstract class, its constructor is private, etc. I think before testing we can ask ourselves "What are we testing for ?", Is it just to check whether that constructor correctly creates that instance for you or any other requirements?

It seems to be the issue with `☹` in error message such as  `☹ OOPS!!! The description of a todo cannot be empty.` in level 5. After removing the emoji, everything works fine. May I ask how to fix this or am I allowed to just remove it from the error message?

The code below was given for the task in week 2 where we have to extract out the classes `Storage`, `TaskList` and `Ui`.

    public Duke(String filePath) {

On top of what @larrywang0701 has said, the iP dashboard is updated daily. So you might need to come back tommorow to see if the script has detected your tag.

If you are still facing issues, you can use these following commands. 

1. Open up your terminal and navigate to your iP folder
2. Type command `git log` to list all the recent commits

For example, mine looks like this:
![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/96157054/c80d85d6-a39a-47cb-a104-7a180a7fba6e)

&hat;My tag above is listed with the merge commit, so I know the merge commit has been tagged correctly. 

From your screenshot, it seems to me that your tag is not attached to the merge commit, which might be what is causing the issue.

1. Run `git log` and make sure all your commits are synced with your local repositiory
2. Delete the old tag from your local repository using `git tag -d &gt;tag-name>`
3. Create the tag on the new commit using `git tag &gt;tag-name> &gt;hash-of-the-merge-commit>`
4. Delete the old tag from the remote repositiory `git push origin --delete &gt;tag-name>`
5. Push the new tag to the remote repository `git push origin &gt;tag-name>`

This method has worked for me before, and it should for you as well 😊

Ok, looks like a Intellij environment related problem. 

**Compare environment between terminal and intellij**
Run `./gradelew -g` from the command line to print the environment variables and system properties. Compare this to the environment in Intellij(`Run` > `Edit Configurations` > `Environment variables`) to make sure if they match.

Update it here if possible also!

Actually I think i noticed the culprit. In the image that you attached at the start of the thread, I noticed that you have a `ParserTest` class that is not in a subdirectory of its own. 

You can do following.
1. If your `Parser` class is not in a package, house it under a package. 
2. Then, make sure the test directory follows the **SAME** file structure as your main code. 

I would expect the `ParserTest` to be under a nested directory and not hanging outside by itself, if this is done correctly. 

Reasoning:
Intellij attempts to understand your file structure and generates test build based off its understanding. So, it is highly likely Intellij has misinterpreted your file stucture. As to why your tests run correctly with your `gradelew` command, I think it is because the build was generated before you made some code changes. Those code changes between the last time you built the jar artifact and now is what caused your test to not run correctly in Intellij.

Further help:
Could you share your full test structure if you don't mind? 

Let me know if this helps in any way

Referring to the image above, `ParserTest` seems to be under package Duke, but from the file structure of your main code, it seems `Parser` is in `main` > `java` > `Duke` > `Tasks` > `Parser`. So I believe the correct test directory should be to move the `ParserTest` into the `Tasks` test directory.

It seems Intellij itself doesn't recognise the test file in this directory, as `ParserTest` is notably highlighted in blue.

I believe the problem is in your build gradle file. Even though in the build task, you have indicated option for `depends on("distZip", "distJar")`, shadow jar probably didn't detect any dependencies associated with those (other) distributions.

Maybe you could try modifying the dependencies task your build gradle file to this 

```java
dependencies {
    testImplementation group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-api', version: '5.10.0'
    testRuntimeOnly group: 'org.junit.jupiter', name: 'junit-jupiter-engine', version: '5.10.0'
    testImplementation 'org.mockito:mockito-core:3.12.4'

    String javaFxVersion = '17.0.8'

    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'mac'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-base', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-controls', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'win'

    implementation group: 'org.openjfx', name: 'javafx-graphics', version: javaFxVersion, classifier: 'linux'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-controls:17.0.8'
}
```
Of course, this would install javaFx version 17.0.8 in your repository (change it to your preferred version)

> &hat;The above is mine. Seems like that might be the issue since it looks like there are only distributions for mac OS but not other OSes. However, my build.gradle file does not have what you have since I used the second method to do set up JavaFX. Adding your recommended dependencies breaks my checkstyle file. Thanks for the hint though!!

Yes yes, the linkage error is caused by Java Fx dependencies. A couple of people who used Java Fx on Mac have faced the same problem regarding the jar file distribution.

The nested dependencies within the dependencies task maybe the issue. You could try replacing your current dependencies task with the task below and see if it works. 

```java
dependencies {

Is this a cross-platform issue that you are facing? (Developed on Windows/Linux but distribution on Mac failed?)
You could refer to #159 and try modifying your build gradle before packaging the jar file. 

Or this is problem faced on your local Macbook? (My guess would be this)
You could refer to #118 (Java fx runtime components missing...)

Hi, this problem might be similar to #159. You could try to make changes to the dependency task in build gradle file within the tp folder and see if the error resolves.

The JavaFX dependency for the Mac M1 (Architecture: ARM 64) differs from Mac Intel (Architecture: x86_64). I assume you are facing this problem.

This first part can be ignored as it is a warning - usually, right before the warning there should be a message asking you to "ignore the JavaFx message".

This is more concerning, you should probably check your `MainWindow.java - line 30` to see where the null pointer exception is being raised.  Likely due to you calling/referencing the attribute of an uninitialized variable.

The green test button is there, but I click it and then nothing noteworthy happens, you can even see on the top left hand side it says no test results yet.
Thankfully gradle tests still function and has feedbacked that some of these tests do not pass, but it becomes hard to debug when I cannot press the green button and see it running.

I had a very niche and difficult issue with nullpointer/failure to load even though my filepath was correct.

Because the github code base was in a cloud drive I’m not sure why but it caused issues. After many hours I tried moving the whole code to local desktop and without changing any code it worked just like that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

In my code, I created the Duke object so that the taskList.Answer() will be run. And that seems to be the root of the problem. Thank you for the helpful tips!

Previously, I solved this encoding issue by adding jvm arguments when running the application:
java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath ../bin Duke < input.txt > ACTUAL.TXT

I have tried the following approaches:
1. setting the system property at the entry of my application:2. 
public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.setProperty("file.encoding", "UTF-8");
        new Duke("data", "tasks.json").run();

2. modifying the following part of the build.gradle file:
application {
    mainClass.set("duke.Duke")
    applicationDefaultJvmArgs = ["-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"]

However, as mentioned by prof @damithc, we do not have control over what kind of terminal users will use to run our application, a solution to set the default encoding when compiling/running the java program using gradle will be required.

I came across a related post below, but I would like to tap on the collective wisdom of all to verify if such a configuration is still required and relevant.

> Fixed the issue with `git config --global core.autocrlf true`. Alternatively, you can set the git config locally in the `.git` folder for the project.

I'm not very bright so please bear with my clarification.

Do you mean that if every team member applies `git config --global core.autocrlf true` in their local machine, then the team should no longer face conflicts arising due to line ending representations across different operating systems?

The is the default `.gitignore` from the forked repo:
```shell
# IDEA files
/.idea/
/out/
/*.iml

# Gradle build files
/.gradle/
/build/
src/main/resources/docs/

# MacOS custom attributes files created by Finder
.DS_Store
*.iml
bin/

/text-ui-test/ACTUAL.TXT
text-ui-test/EXPECTED-UNIX.TXT
```

So only `text-ui-test/ACTUAL.TXT` and `text-ui-test/EXPECTED-UNIX.TXT` are untracked by Git.

In order words, your testing input file `text-ui-test/input.txt` and the expected output file `text-ui-test/EXPECTED.TXT` will still be tracked and can be committed 😄

# Project: Staff-Snap

> ***Craigton Lian's*** *Project Portfolio Page*<br>

### Overview<hr>
Staff-Snap is a desktop HR management application used for managing employees. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about <span style="color:red">**[TO BE UPDATED]**</span> 10 kLoC.

### Summary of Contributions<hr>

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * <span style="color:red">**[TO BE UPDATED]**</span> Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()
    * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
  * Developer Guide:
    * <span style="color:red">**[TO BE UPDATED]**</span> Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

* **Community**:
  * <span style="color:red">**[TO BE UPDATED]**</span> PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): 
      [\#31](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-1/tp/pull/31), 
      [\#32](), 
      [\#19](), 
      [\#42]()
  * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: 
      [\#2](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/2), 
      [\#121](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/121),

  * <span style="color:red">**[TO BE UPDATED]**</span> Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())

* **Tools**:
  * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
  * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo

Excellent detective work @tlylt ! 

Is there any way we can check if the markbind action will go through error-free before merging the PR? I feel like even though I can see a preview of the markdown file in my IDE during editing, it doesn't always build correctly when shipped to gh-pages. 

Basically, what I'm asking is, is there a way to check how the MarkBind will render before I merge the PR?

Hi prof, I am on a windows machine, however when i do java -version it gave me 19 version, I tried deleting it and now when i run the same command it did not give any output. I have both sdk 11 and 19, I ensured that in intellij it is getting compiled with SDK 11, but now after deleting SDK 19, it is not showing me any output when I run java -version. I also checked Environment variables the SDK 11 path is there.

3. When running Duke.java, get error: JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application. <br/><br/>

Error "LinkageError occurred while loading main class duke.Duke" when trying to run Duke.java after building JAR File. Steps to reproduce error:
1. Complete all tasks before A-Jar.
2. Complete A-Jar using _With Gradle_ method. * Edit line 31 in build.gradle, from _mainClass.set("seedu.duke.Duke")_ to _mainClass.set("duke.Duke")_
3. Navigate to build.libs and run _java -jar duke.jar_. duke.jar executes successfully.

@woojiahao 

Thanks for your help! I believe I have had both Java 11 and Java 17 installed previously.

My particular error: 
Files executed successfully if SDK under Project Structure is 17. Since this project requires Java 11, I tried switching SDK to 11 but when running Duke.java, error occurs. 

My steps of resolving the error:
1. File -&gt; Project Structure -&gt; SDK (choose 11) -&gt; Language Level (choose Default) -&gt; Apply -&gt; OK. (https://www.baeldung.com/intellij-change-java-version from CS2040S setup / @woojiahao )

2. IntelliJ IDEA (beside File) -&gt; Build, Execution, Deployment -&gt; Compiler -&gt; Java Compiler -&gt; Project bytecode version (set to 11) -&gt; Apply -&gt; OK. (from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67098514/java-error-release-version-17-not-supported)

3. Build (same menu bar as File and IntelliJ IDEA) -&gt; Rebuild Project.

4. Run Duke.java. Should run successfully.

Hi @lsyurea 
Currently my attempt is to follow the guide link sent by @shishirbychapur (the alternative way for gradle stated on CS2103T website). I'm able to get the GUI, but still have this warning

A very good evening @damithc . Thank you so much for the clarification. 
With that in mind, I would conclude that the feasible way for me to solve the issue is by following this guide. https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#gradle stated by @shishirbychapur .

Hi @s-peiran. 
My steps are:
1. Create a branch base on the content of master.
2. Make edits on branch.
3. Commit changes to branch.
4. Merge branch into master. (I guess you've missed this and hence your master is not up to date with branch 7?)
5. Make tag for this comit.
6. Push master, new branch, and all tags. (When you click the Push in Sourcetree, you need to check the checkboxes of master and the branch, and also  the push all tags.
7. Repeat the steps for next task.

I spotted that you've merge master into branch 7 which might cause a bit problem -- you're updating branch 7 but not master.

Hi @Vanessamae23 ,

If this "implementation group" method still does not work for you, you could consider referring to issue #72  in closed issues. In short, use the alternative way (adding the `javafx {  }` block).

```..\..\..\..\data\duke.txt (The system cannot find the path specified)```

Anyone has any idea why this happens? Is there an issue with my relative pathing? Attached below is my file directory and my `Duke.java` file
I previously used the absolute path `data/duke.txt` which worked, and now I face this issue when I try to change to relative paths.

Any help is much appreciated!

I am confused regarding how to implement assertions for Week 5 project. Are we supposed to run Duke.main()? Because earlier in Week 4 - Project, this was mentioned:

``` Note that you no longer need to keep the text-based UI after adding a GUI. Similarly, there is no need to use the I/O redirection style automated testing anymore (that technique is suited for text UIs only). ```

So do we still have to maintain our text-based UI on top of our GUI chatbot? Because from my understanding, assertions are only relevant when you run Duke.main, and are not relevant when you run the GUI chatbot. I ask this because I get this error when I try to run Duke.main ```JavaFX runtime components are missing, and are required to run this application```, and so I'm wondering if I need to fix this or simply remove everything that is not related to running the GUI chatbot

Thanks all for replies! The issue was that the working directory where my main method was run from was different from where my runtest.bat was run from, so when I tried to run runtest.bat there were issues due to the wrong relative pathing. Fixed it by running runtest.bat from the IP directory instead of the text-ui-test directory, but because of this had to change certain parts of runtest.bat to point to the correct ACTUAL.TXT and EXPECTED.TXT

Currently I installed gradle by merging the add-gradle-support branch with my master branch, and deleting the .idea file. However I do not have the gradle icon in my Intellij. I can do all the gradle operation ./gradle run etc in command line regardless. 

But because of this I cannot do "Load Gradle changes" as outlined in #42 because I am facing the same issue of unable to import JUnit for testing. So do I go and import the gradle plugin from intellij to circumvent the issue?

The only mishap is at the last step on the screenshot above, I only pushed master but not branch Level-7. I have pushed the tag Level-8 to git, but it seems that only tags pushed to master will be detected by the progress dashboard? Can someone explain why does the master branch does not follow up to the most updated commit? And at this point how do I make the progress dashboard detect branch-Level 7 and branch Level 8, such that I will be following the objective of the course.

Relative path is the location of the file relative to the working directory while absolute relative is location from the root directory. Based on @WZWren reply, you can also trace back after generating the relative file path to have a better understanding of how it works

I agree with @kokrui, we can also dedicate a separate `txt` file for when we run `runtest.sh` (and purging it before every run). What I did was to allow `Duke` to access different files via different pathnames. 

I've also noticed that the relative pathnames resolve differently in `Duke.java` and when we use `runtest.sh`.

Hey, I think you should modify your ~`.sh` script~ code to also create `data/duke.txt` if it doesn't exist.

Edit: It should be done in the java code instead, you might also want to reset the file to blank state before each run of the test.

Hey, with `package duke / package duke.exceptions` as you've mentioned and your project structure, what worked for me was to mark `src/main/java` as your Sources Root directory. This way the packages are identified relative to it.

After removing Java 19 and installing Java 11, I created a new linus.jar file that runs well on my machine(Windows). However, I am unsure if it really is compiled under Java 11, nor its compatibility with Linux and MacOS. Would really appreciate if anyone running Linux/MacOS could help me do a smoke test!

This is the fix for my problem in case anyone encounters the same thing for cross platform issues

I haven't had any issues working across Windows and macOS with the same git repository. 

However, I have faced issues when accessing the same repository on Windows WSL (Ubuntu) as described in: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53900839/git-repo-gives-contradictory-info-from-wsl-than-from-windows

TLDR: Difference in the way line endings are interpreted causes conflicts on every line.

Fixed the issue with `git config --global core.autocrlf true`. Alternatively, you can set the git config locally in the `.git` folder for the project.

> Do you mean that if every team member applies `git config --global core.autocrlf true` in their local machine, then the team should no longer face conflicts arising due to line ending representations across different operating systems?

You can read https://blog.chapagain.com.np/git-fix-differences-created-by-line-endings-in-files/ and https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration (search autocrlf) for more information on the differences.

TLDR: 
If you don't face any issues, then I guess it's fine to leave things as they are. Otherwise, you can do:  
`git config --global core.autocrlf true` on Windows
`git config --global core.autocrlf input` on macOS/Linux

I'm not 100% sure about whether everyone needs to do this on their own machine. I think it suffices if the person facing the conflicts does it. Would be good if more people can confirm.

Read: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244954/why-cant-i-just-create-another-scanner-object-after-using-scanner-close

TLDR: It seems that sc.close() closes the `System.in` input stream, which means you can't recreate a new Scanner from it again.

I'm not able to see your git tags when visiting your repository. Maybe verify again that you have pushed the tags?

From your profile:

It seems like you haven't pushed your tags to GitHub.

When you run `git tag` on your machine, it only creates the tags in your local repository. Doing `git push` will only push your commits to the remote repository, and will not include the tags you have created locally. You have to do an extra step of `git push --tags` to push your local tags to the remote repository. 

See https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/22#issuecomment-1691864201 for an overview of what you should be doing.

You can confirm this by checking your repository.

In my opinion, there are two factors to consider:
1. How many people are working together on the repository?
2. Which branch are you pushing to?

For iP, since you're working alone on the project, it's probably quite reasonable to do so. If you don't like having buggy code in `master`, you could always branch out to resolve the code first, then merge back into `master` later on. If you really hate buggy commits in particular, you can do things like `git commit --amend` or `git rebase` to clear buggy commits after you fix them, but note that those will probably require a force push afterward.

For tP, you probably want to avoid pushing to branches that are shared with your group mates, in case they accidentally pull from them. I'm not sure what the tP structure is, but if it's done in forks, then it shouldn't be a big issue anyway.

I think that your bot should check if the file exists, if it does it should load that file at the start to show the previous tasks, if it does not it can create the file and maybe tell the user that it has created a file. Then after each command, it updates the file accordingly.

Hi @TiwKangXu ,

I agree with @geraldngjx that I think the issue leading to this error might be that your main class name in build.gradle and your actual package name in your code.

For me, my Duke.java is located such that: src > main > java > duke > Duke.java. Therefore, my build.gradle looks like:

application {
mainClass.set("duke.Duke")
}

You can just clean your build using gradle and rename your mainClass or package name to make them consistent, before repeating the steps for A-Jar using gradle.

My GUI looks pretty much like the one in the JavaFX tutorial except that I chaged the images for Duke and the User. For anyone who had troubles with their text becoming an ellipsis in the dialog box, you can remove the prefHeight in the VBox in the MainWindow.fxml

Hello professor and classmates

When my iP program starts to run (both in IDEA and running the fat jar with `java -jar` command), the GUI window currectly pops out, but also leaving a warning message in the console
`Unsupported JavaFX configuration: classes were loaded from 'unnamed module @xxxxxxxx'`
(where xxxxxxxx is some random hexadecimal numbers, seems like some kind of object address)
Since it seems that this warning doesn't affect anything in my iP (everything works well except the warning itself), should I just submit the final version of my iP ignoring this warning, or should I fix that before submission? If I need to fix this warning, what should I do? 
(I confirm that JavaFX is inside my fat jar since when I unzip my jar file I see all javafx files inside)
Since the deadline for final iP submission is approaching, if this warning won't affect grading or any other thing, I may just ignore it  and save more time for checking and finalizing other things in iP.
Thanks!

Hello professors and classmates

At the first day when I started using SourceTree, I noticed that whenever I push to remote repo, a window will pop up:
![image](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/113608053/e74aaeb6-18b0-4235-a359-5cf0a24245a9)
It will pop twice with the same content, and I just directly click the "select" button twice.

But these days I found out that this window also automatically pops even though I didn't do any push actions or actions related to the remote repo. Same as when I manually push to remote repos, it pops twice. Sometimes I just left SourceTree stays in the system background without closing it, and when I was doing other things with my device, this window also frequently pops up randomly at any time. (Even when I'm writing this question now, it pops again in the background!) **Just like SourceTree is pushing something to the remote repo by itself even without my comfirmation???** Since weeks ago it won't like this, so I tried to solve it. But I couldn't solve it and even deleting all files in local repo then re-clone from remote repo won't solve. Could someone told me why this window pops automatically in the background randomly (without any direction operation or action from me) and how to solve this problem? (My OS is Windows 10) Thanks.

Hello professors and classmates.
From my prior project experiences, I believe that making more classes in my OOP framework will make the overall framework more flexible, modularized and easy to expand, maintaince and use. But one day when I was in high school, my teacher told me that not all programs needs such amount of divided classes and such large framework since designing the framework itself is also time-costly and too-large framework may also be bad. This is totally differ from what I previously believed. So I'm curious about the answer to this question. **Does "dividing everything into separate classes" really a good practice in SE?** Thanks!

From my experiences, commonly when your program needs to store files locally (I've used this before in my video game projects, about storing player records for the game), here is what I usually do:
```
First, check whether the specific file exists on the disk
  If the file not exists, use one of the two options below:
    --Create the file and initialize the file with initial contents. Then check whether the creation is successful or not. (Exception may happen when space is not enough, doesn't have permission (e.g.: Windows UAC) etc. ) and preceed to the next step
    --Use initial data for this user session, skip the next step and write data later in the write phase (actually I prefer this one)
  If the file exists:
    Preceed to the next step
Second, preceed read/write the file like normal. (the so-called "next step" in the above sentences)
```

So to your question, option 2 is much more reasonable than option 1 since users are not expected to create the data file by themselves in this situation. And what's more, I think you don't need to ask the user whether to save the file, just save it automatically to increase the ease of usage.

Try "Level-x" with uppercase "L" instead of lowercase in your tag name? (I'm not sure whether the dashboard system is case sensitive or not)  (update: I see your level-8 can be detacted from your screenshot, so this may not be the main reason for your problem)
Also, go to check that whether you really **created the branch** for level 8, javadoc, coding standard and level 9 and then merge and then tag the merged comment in master branch as required?

No from his screenshot he tagged his commit 5 days ago already @AlagappanRa 
As his branches are also not detacted, I guess he may failed to follow the branch requirements in iP, thus causing the problem (just guessing)

I can not see your branch names from your screenshot, so it's hard for me to give you more helpful information. But instead of just correcting your correct commits, why not try deleting all of your current tags that can not be correctly detacted, **then follow the iP requirements last week starting from A-Packages again all over again?**
Since from my experience, Github commits is really easy to messed up if you are not sure what you are doing (**you may make more mistakes and make your repo more messy during fixing**), so just redo everything may be better than try to fix the current wrong one.

But still weird, though your tags may not be pushed, why your branches on the right is also red?
Did you also forget to push your branches to the remote repo?
I push everytime I make a commit or tag a commit so I never encounter a problem like yours.
Tomorrow if the dashboard is updated but your detaction is still red, then you may need to come back again.

Hi, I was looking at the iP progress dashboard and realized that my branch-level-8 was not registered by the script:

<img width="883" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/19762596/e3cbea51-ed14-47d0-851c-8e9e8f82760c">

I suspect that the reason is because I made a mistake in merging that branch to my master branch earlier on, and didn't actually merge that branch to my master branch but instead I accidentally copied those changes over. (i.e. I have completed Level-8 but I did so on the master branch, so all my relevant code is on the master branch).

<img width="342" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/19762596/5d68902f-e47f-4882-943f-ca331cae7b40">

Is there any way I can rectify this? I'm hesitant to merge the old branch-level-8 with my current master branch as I don't want my code to be messed up, is there any safe way to do so without the merge commit affecting my current code base?

On macOS, JDK versions are permanently installed in /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines. You need to `cd` into that directory and `sudo rm -rf` that particular version of Java. The Application Support directory contains Java itself (the Application to support the running of Java apps on macOS), which (iirc) is different from JDK (the Java Development Kit used to compile and run Java code).

@lunaroddity I can't tell from your screenshots, but if you entered the command "bye", and only then received the build success message, then that means the gradle run was successful. However, if the program exited immediately, then that might be an issue, as in my case the program only indicated the success message after I input the "bye" command. In fact, the program ran normally for every command until I input the "bye" command.

@D-Limiter I had the same issue on macOS, I tried `./gradlew shadowJar` without the `clean` option and it worked afterwards, although I'm not sure why, maybe you can try that. Additionally, you could also try running the shadowJar command from Gradle in IntelliJ instead of the command line.

From website:

Q. How are the iP git tags used in grading?

A. Adding a git tag in the iP is a self-declaration that you think you are done with the iP increment. We take your word for it. We don't check the code to see if you have actually done the said increment. Therefore, it is just a mechanism for you to self-declare progress and for us to monitor those progress declarations.

So I think you can just change it at the Level-5 commit onwards

> @lihongguang00 You are mixing up commit messages with tags. Previously, you used `Level-0` etc. as commit messages instead of tags. That's why there were no tags in your repo. When doing a release, GitHub automatically creates a tag, but that is just a side effect, not the intended way to create a tag.

Hi prof, I'm new to git and it's quite confusing so please correct me if my current sequence of git commands is wrong.

`git tag &gt;relevant_tag>`
`git push`

Another thing you can try is to push a commit to your fork (e.g. ammend the README file) and create a pull request.

Hey, I would like to suggest trying out the [second method](https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#gradle). 
I could not set up JavaFX properly with the first method too but this one worked for me! I tweaked the steps a little to make it work for my project and the import statements (finally) got recognized :)

Setup steps(some steps are slightly different since the version of JavaFX that the tutorial uses is JavaFX 17.0.7):
1. In your build.gradle file, add the following to your `build.gradle` file on top of your existing plugins:
(this adds the JavaFX plugin for Gradle)
```
plugins {
    id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.0.13'
}
```
2. In your `build.gradle` file, also add the following:
(the snippet below specifies that JavaFX 17.0.7 should be used, and that we need the 'javafx.controls' & 'javafx.fxml' modules, FXML can be omitted if you do not plan to use FXML to develop your chatbot GUI)
```
javafx {
    version = "17.0.7"
    modules = [ 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml' ]
}
```
3. Run your `build.gradle` file:
- Linux/Mac: `./gradlew run`
- Windows: `gradlew run`

Really hope this helps! Jiayous!

&hat;The above is mine. Seems like that might be the issue since it looks like there are only distributions for mac OS but not other OSes. However, my build.gradle file does not have what you have since I used the second method to do set up JavaFX. Adding your recommended dependencies breaks my checkstyle file. Thanks for the hint though!!

Ok thanks prof. I have taken these steps so far:
- Revert all traces of the second step by removing the JavaFX SDK and updating build.gradle to the first method
- loaded gradle changes
- ran: ./gradlew build
- Managed to get the project structure to the state that @AlagappanRa described:

Hi Delton, I think you can refer to the additions to the build.gradle file that @AlagappanRa mentioned [above](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/159#issuecomment-1728708305). I have fixed several issues related to the somewhat emotionally motivated [post](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/159#issuecomment-1728126734) that I had made regarding reverting back to the first version so I'll be sharing more about how I fixed it in the next post.

Thanks @AlagappanRa :)

As for the checkstyle breaking, it turns out that I did not delete the module-info.java file from my repo, which is required for the first method of installing but not the second. So if anyone is reverting to the first method of including JavaFX, you might want to follow the steps below for reverting to the first method:
- Remove any JavaFX SDKs that you might have installed for the second method(delete it from whereever that you might have placed the JavaFX SDK in when you first set up JavaFX)
- Remove these lines that you had to add for the second method from your `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
javafx {
    version = "17.0.7"
    modules = [ 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml' ]
}
```
- Delete any module-info.java files(not needed for including JavaFX using the first method)
- Include these lines in your dependencies file(credits: @AlagappanRa):
```gradle
dependencies {
    // JavaFX 17.0.7 dependencies for macOS on ARM64
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-base:17.0.7:mac-aarch64'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-controls:17.0.7:mac-aarch64'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-fxml:17.0.7:mac-aarch64'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-graphics:17.0.7:mac-aarch64' 

    // JavaFX 17.0.7 dependencies for Linux
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-base:17.0.7:linux'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-controls:17.0.7:linux'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-fxml:17.0.7:linux'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-graphics:17.0.7:linux'

    // JavaFX 17.0.7 dependencies for Windows
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-base:17.0.7:win'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-controls:17.0.7:win'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-fxml:17.0.7:win'
    implementation 'org.openjfx:javafx-graphics:17.0.7:win'
}
```
- note: what the above lines do is to include distributions for other OSes(as described in the comments), so the resulting jar file generated will be cross-platform(I have yet to try it out on other OSes but I will keep everyone posted)
- Next, run `./gradlew build` in order to set up the project dependencies to include the required JavaFX components in your project
- Verify that the dependencies have been added by going to `File -&gt; Project Structure -&gt; Project Settings -&gt; Modules -&gt; Dependencies`. You should see the below:

- Ensure your ip still works by running your ip as per usual
- Ensure that your checkstyle still works after making the above changes(if applicable)

Hi prof,
Editing my build.gradle file seemed to have did the trick. 
In case anyone is facing the same issue, refer to issue #159

**Update: The jar file works on multiple platforms**

TL:DR - Ensure the following:
- Correct JDK version(especially for mac users)
- `build.gradle` for the javaFX components is configured correctly
- If reverting from the second version of setting up JavaFX to the first, ensure that all traces of the second method are deleted(e.g. the JavaFX JDK & `module-info.java`)
- JavaFX dependencies are present in the project structure

Hello everyone!

I'm seeking volunteers to help me conduct a smoke test on my ip release which is currently available on GitHub. While I've tested on a Mac, I'm particularly interested in how it performs on non-Mac machines.

### **Details**
- **Repository:** Tim-Siu/ip
- **Release:** [A-Release](https://github.com/Tim-Siu/ip/releases/tag/A-Release)

Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated!

I was following a JavaFX tutorial, but I've encountered a problem where my dialogue text label seems to automatically collapse when there's not enough space. I would appreciate some guidance on how to resolve this.

### Here are the screenshots for a clearer view:

I am unsure why, but when I try to build the `shadowJar`, I am unable to obtain a functional `jar` file.

However, for reason unknown, using `./gradlew shadowJar` results in a functional `jar` file. 

Anyone knows why Intellij can't build a functional `jar` file? If `./gradlew shadowJar` functions well, can I just ignore the fact that my Intellij can't build a functional `jar` file?

<panel  header="**1. :fas-info-circle: Issue with Scanners importing files**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/55" expanded>

While working on Level-7, I encountered a strange issue:
```
File taskFile = new File(somePathToATxtFile);
            Scanner setup = new Scanner(taskFile);
           //some intermediate code 
            while(setup.hasNext()){
                //load task into the list
                //while loop does not loop
            }
```
In this piece of code, i try to initialize my list with tasks in the txt file, but the task is not loaded into the list.

```
File taskFile = new File(somePathToATxtFile);
            Scanner setup = new Scanner(taskFile);
           //some intermediate code 
           if(setup.hasNext()){
               System.out.println("hasNext"); //this piece of code runs!
           }
            while(setup.hasNext()){
                //load task into the list
                //while loop starts looping
            }
```
for some reason when I check if the setup scanner is empty or not, the tasks are now loaded into the list!

Can someone explain why checking if the scanner hasNext fixes this code?

regarding the issue mentioned in [https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/6](url) , the following error rises when a "new" Scanner is created during a while loop that doesn't terminate until "bye" is detected:
```
Exception in thread "main" java.util.NoSuchElementException: No line found
        at java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextLine(Scanner.java:1656)
        at Cracker.startService(Cracker.java:15)
        at Cracker.main(Cracker.java:67)
 
```
Why does this arise when manually entering the input does not throw any exceptions?
My hypothesis is that System.in throws the .txt file into the scanner and when a new Scanner is created, the txt file is somehow cleared.

        sc.close();
        sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println(sc.next());
```

Apparently you can only close Scanners once.
when I tried running the code above, i would be returned with a NoSuchElementException.
Why doesn't declaring a new Scanner reopen the Scanner?

Do we need to create multiple scanners? absolutely not. I'm just curious why creating more scanners will cause problems during automated testing.

So what you're trying to say is that during automated testing the First scanner will close System.in for some reason when creating a new scanner? That's quite weird.

Apparently, I have found some crucial code that caused the while loop to terminate.
The problem is i tried to open a new FileWriter that passed in the same file in the Scanner.
Here is a code that demonstrates this: 
```
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ScannerTester {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        FileWriter writer = null;
        File taskFile = new File("./data/list.txt");
        Scanner setup = null ;

        try{
            setup = new Scanner(taskFile);
            writer = new FileWriter(taskFile);
        } catch (Exception e){
            System.out.println(e);
        }
        System.out.println(setup.hasNext());
        while(setup.hasNext()){
            System.out.println(setup.next());
        }
        

    }
} 
```
The output will be false.
Running setup.hasNext() before creating the FileWriter will fix the problem for some reason, and the while loop will start looping. This still confuses me.

Thanks for the answer! This certainly explains why I can't retrieve any more lines from the Scanner. However, this code below works for some reason.
```
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ScannerTester {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        FileWriter writer = null;
        File taskFile = new File("./data/list.txt");
        Scanner setup = null ;

        try{
            setup = new Scanner(taskFile);
            setup.hasNext(); //adding this line activates the loop
            writer = new FileWriter(taskFile);
        } catch (Exception e){
            System.out.println(e);
        }
        System.out.println(setup.hasNext());
        while(setup.hasNext()){
            System.out.println(setup.next());
        }
        

    }
} 
```
Here's how i understand this program:
After I input the file into the scanner, i check hasNext() and should return true (Have not opened filewriter yet)
Afterwards i open the fileWriter, flushing the entire file.
When check the condition of the while loop, it will fail and nothing will happen.

However, adding that one line before opening the fileWriter changes something and I'm not sure how.

Hi I am trying to style my GUI to make it look better. I referred to the code written by @shishirbychapur (Thank you so much and I credited you in my code). However, after I created a chat bubble for containing the text message, I am unable to wrap the text. Previously, I was able to wrap my text with the most basic GUI.

The `Label `that contained my message already has `wrapText = "true"` and I feel that probably something else is interfering with it. 
However, I cannot find out exactly where is the problem. 😢

I am not exactly sure...I'm running Ubuntu 22.04😢 I did encounter difficulties launching GUI for apache jmeter before (broken GUI that is partially shown) and I couldn't solve it. Not sure if this time the same problem will occur. 

May I know if WSL is related to the problem of running gradle project? Also, what do I do if I indeed run into issues adding GUI later...

Thank you for those who took the time to help me debug. I have solved the problem by running git bash instead of Ubuntu. I believe it is a Ubuntu problem. I tried switching to powershell / command prompt first but their commands are different from the Linux commands I am used to. Git bash provides a command line interface for the windows system, emulating the linux environment. Hence simpler for me. Hope there won't be any more problems.

Thank you for the suggestions! I updated my `build.gradle` to be the same as @jx124 but realised it still doesn't work because of java issues. Then I uninstalled the current version of Java and reinstalled again. I also reset my environment variables, project sdk and gradle sdk to point to the newly installed version of Java. Then things went well.

Thank you @jx124 and prof for taking the time to answer my queries!

Hi all, would like to ask for help with regards to this scenario that happens in order:
1) Currently working on a branch in my local repo
2) A teammate of mine have finished their branch feature, pushed it into their fork and create a pull request to the upstream repo (the team's repo) master branch.
3) I reviewed it and approved of the pull request and merged the pull request with the upstream repo's master branch
4) To ensure my local repo is in sync with the upstream repo, I pull the master branch of the upstream repo into my local repo
5) I then push the master branch of the local repo into my fork to ensure that it is in sync

My question here is, between step 4 and step 5, the branch that I am working on will not be the synced master branch that I pulled in step 4. Hence, how do I ensure that that the branch that I am working on is in sync with the pulled master branch?

The line where it says "Added remark to Person:..." seem like is outputting the object itself. I've ensured that my toString() method in the Person class is the same as the one in the tutorial. The link to my branch is here: https://github.com/brendanneojw/tp/tree/tutorial-adding-command

The difference is that in the given README.md file, it is given to be describing the "Features" first then the "Usage" of the action to achieve this feature (the first picture) while the AB3 User's Guide kinda combine them both (the second picture)

Hi all I would like to clarify if the checking of the file/directory that we are supposed to save to should be done:
1. At the start of the program, if file/directory doesn't exist then exit the whole program
2. Keep the programming running while taking user input, if file/directory doesn't exist, user can choose to create it and do not have to exit the whole program

In my opinion, I think the 2nd option would be more intuitive and if deciding to go even more adventurous, the program can even create the directory and file for the user. Of course additional checks have to be done to ensure security and permission rights.

Hi prof, i did the checkout at each branch before my final implementation at Level 9 and realised that JUnit testing does work already. I'm quite confused though because at certain branches it doesn't work but as some it does. However it seems like there may be file changes that could cause it and my master branch is able to perform the JUnit testing already. Thank you!

I understand that I could just change `archiveBaseName = &gt;botname>.jar` to `archiveBaseName = &gt;botname>` to get `&gt;botname>.jar`, that is why it is a pedantic question. My question is do I follow the guide here? Or should I not  follow the guide and edit the archiveBaseName?

The documentation itself does say we should push this to the remote, but doesn't this directly contradict the idea that we shouldn't push binaries to the repository? Can't we get the users to generate this file themselves?

@JasonRay You need to add the `@FXML` labels to `dialog` and `displayPicture` - otherwise your FXML files will not be able to detect the variables.

You can see this from your error message - its leading you to line 41 with a `NullPointerException` - you are calling `setText` on an uninitialized label, so it's not automatically loading in from the FXML file.

> The 2 fields dialog and displayPicture were used, but the corresponding field declarations at the top was not highlighted purple, meaning it is not used

Regarding this, the IDE doesn't seem to detect variable usage in FXML files, even with the `@FXML` tag - don't be too alarmed by this.

Hey @zacwong2151, I believe you can use the path `./data/duke.txt` to fix this issue - the IDE runs the program as if the `ip` folder is the root.

On a side note, you can look into the `java.nio.file.Paths` library - in particular, the `Paths.get` method can generate a relative path that is usable across different OS platforms, without having to deal with the file separators.

> I was digging around the OpenJFX documentation and found this section that complements the second method of importing JavaFX for Gradle. Maybe you can try testing this out?

@woojiahao Forgive me for being out of the loop here, but I don't really understand what you mean by "second method of importing JavaFX into gradle". Was there a section that I had missed on the site? I had followed the JavaFX tutorial [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFxPart1.html) so I am unaware about a second method.

OK, so it seems like this was a Java version issue - the Mac that this was tested on was not the one given in the advisory, and due to some miscommunication, we had thought that changing the version did not fix the issue when it in fact it had fixed it.

One interesting thing that had arose here though was that the tester was using Java Launcher to test the jar files - from what I can see Java Launcher could only test 1 of the 3 jar files she was supplied with from different iP projects, but the other 2 jar files could only be launched without error from the terminal using `java -jar nameOfJar.jar`.

The only major difference I could see in the build.gradle files for that jar file compared to the other 2 was the inclusion of the `checkstyle` module (possibly related to [this](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/159#issuecomment-1729226821)). The 2 jar files that failed to run had the `checkstyle` module configured while the 1 that ran did not have it at all.

While the errors have been resolved, I would still appreciate if additional people could test if they can open the program on Mac to confirm if the program can run on the OS.

About the JavaFX warning, I get it too. My SceneBuilder app seems to save FXMLs in V20.0.1 even if I manually change the version in the raw file and reload. For me, my warning says my JavaFX runtime is `17-internal`. I hope it will be fine. I [searched it up a bit](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65991076/11536796), so maybe I can look into that for the TP.

Referring to these issues (https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/forum/issues/49, https://github.com/nusCS2113-AY1920S1/forum/issues/35), I tried doing this for GetUserInput() instead:
```java

           return sc.nextLine();
        }
        return "\n";
    }
```
but when I run my runtest.bat file, there's no output and the indicator below ./runtest.bat keeps blinking and I have to terminate the batch job.

I agree with @woojiahao about ensuring that `Bar` is properly unit tested separately. One example I can think of is if `Bar` is a `String` so `fooMethod()` will return a `String`. It wouldn't make sense to test how the `String` is being created but rather just assume that its being created correctly. If theres anything wrong with the `String` class creation, it should be caught by the `String` classes unit tests (which i'm sure the people creating the standard Java library have done so).

For the first, the coding standard states:
```
Constant names must be all uppercase using underscore to separate words.
```
I believe that constant means it has to be a static variable. Otherwise, for every instance of the class, I can have a different value of that variable. Hence, we use camelCase in this case.
For the second, it states:
```
Plural form should be used on names representing a collection of objects.
```
Hence, I think we should use ```tasks``` as the name instead. However, if there is a case where ```taskList``` is needed for some reason, we notice the following below the standard:
```
Rationale: Enhances readability since the name gives the user an immediate clue of the type of the variable and the operations that can be performed on its elements. One space character after the variable type is enough to obtain clarity.
```
Hence, I think it is okay to leave it in singular form as it hints to people that it is only one list.

<panel  header="**2. :fas-info-circle: What to do if increment requires multiple actions (e.g. branch-then-merge with tags) but was already completed previously**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/27" expanded>

I understand that if some increments have been implemented in prior weeks, we can either tag the relevant commit or latest commit with said increment. However, what if an increment requires more actions than just a commit tag?

---

For example, in my case, I wrote documentation as I code by habit. Hence, I might have no commits to do in `branch-A-JavaDoc`, nothing to tag `A-JavaDoc` to, etc. 

Suppose I still: 
- create the `branch-A-JavaDoc` branch anyway, 
- tag the top commit with `A-JavaDoc`, and 
- push it with no additional commits (so `master` and `branch-A-JavaDoc` are still pointing to the same commit).

Would that be okay for the auto-grader, or should I intentionally leave some docs out just so I can make a commit with the branch?

Similarly, does this apply to all future increments which may require multiple steps, but are inadvertently completed previously?

A situation where having a `Storage` class may help is if you plan to store other data files alongside your task list in the future (for example, user settings), and you want to ensure they are stored in a common system- or user-defined location.

Example: Data storage conventions are different across different OSes. For instance, these are possible conventions you might follow (may differ depending on environmental variables or OS versions):

- Windows: `~/AppData/Local/AppName/`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/AppName`
- Other Linux/Unix variants: `~/.config/AppName`

where `~` represents the home directory.

By having a separate `Storage` class, even if it is simply a wrapper on top of the built-in `File`, you can abstract away any operations dealing with the base directory. For instance, when providing a relative path to `Storage` to save a file to, it may auto-create a missing base directory behind the scenes, then auto-prepend the appropriate base directory to the provided relative path before saving.

With this separate wrapper class, any new files used by future features can easily share the same behaviour above.

</panel>

<panel  header="**5 :fas-comment:**" popup-url="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/30#issuecomment-1695913396" expanded>

I believe the reasons mentioned in 1 and 2 are actually two sides of the same coin. 

Notice `File` and other relevant Java classes themselves are also classes that:

1. require the user to continuously call it, and 
2. requires data passed to it to function. 

and hence technically exhibits the same problem you noted in reason 2. 

With that, since `Storage` is an intermediary of `File` operations (reason 1) it hence makes sense that it exhibits the same "dependency" on each other like `File` (reason 2). 

I feel these design concerns aren't really a big issue if even Java is organised this way.

---

Personally, I think whether you decouple TaskList and Storage is okay either way:

- **IO operations in Storage:** 
  - Since the provided `File` Java APIs also have ways to load and save with different formats via polymorphism, if the purpose of `Storage` is to be a higher-level IO wrapper for internal files, having said class could possibly help in code organisation and future convenience.
  - See also: Java's `BufferedReader`, which is designed to take in and wrap another reader such as `FileReader` for improved performance via buffering.

- **IO operations in TaskList**: 
  - Since it's only used in one place at the moment and we are focusing on iterating on the iP, calling Java File IO APIs within `TaskList` directly has no real downsides yet.

FYI to all, you may run any script automatically in your browser by simply getting a **userscript** browser extension (available on most browsers, e.g., [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo), [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/app/userscripts/id1463298887)), then creating your own userscript. For example, this is sufficient for me:

```js
// ==UserScript==
// @name        CS2103T Menu Autoexpander
// @description Automatically expands all collapsed menus on the CS2103T website.
// @match       *://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/website/*
// ==/UserScript==

const collapsibles = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.card-header'));
const uncollapsed = collapsibles.filter(node => {
    const glyph = node.querySelector('.glyphicon');
    if (!glyph) return false;
    return glyph.classList.contains('glyphicon-chevron-right');
});
uncollapsed.forEach(node => node.click());
```

You can do this for any other site as well! :)

This only happens for automated testing. The error messages never appear when I manually run the program, and other interactions all behave normally in the test.

Our tp design involves three types of users: project manager, team leader and developer. Each has different level of accessibility to the stored information. It is like project manager can create, read and write; Team leader can read and write; And developer can only read.

We are planning to ask the user what is your type of user when our application starts and enable functionalities accordingly. In this way, only one user is using the system at one time on a single computer, but does this satisfies the Single-User Constraint of tp?

If not, then we are planning to make our target user be only the project manager, but we are just worried that not sufficent work is done for tp.

So our project is creating a tree structure to store contact information of a team for a sofeware development project where the root node the is the project manager's contact information. Others are divided into groups with one team leader for each group. The project manager has reference to all the team leaders. The team leaders have reference to the project manager and the developers in their group while all developers only have reference to their team leader.

It is up to the project manager to create the tree structure first and team leaders can help fill in all the contact information. Then, if anyone, including developers, needs to find someone's contact information. He can use our application to find it.

Our system will just store all the contact information added by the PM and team leaders on the computer which our applicaiton runs on. When other users come and use our application on the computer, the system will display the contact information, maybe with some addtional information as well, and that is all. However, the PM has the ability to hide his contact information to developers because they should contact their team leaders first rather than contact the PM directly.

Team leaders can edit or update his and his developers' information, but only the PM can create or delete identities (ie. add or delete a developer or a team leader). All the modifications are done on one computer and developers can just search and view.

Try modifying your `Duke` class such that it has an empty constructor. Perhaps your filePath string can be a constant.

You added the dependencies to Gradle, so it will only work when you run with Gradle.

It works because Duke works with an empty constructor not so much because the filepath is a constant. The `Application.launch` takes in a class which extends the `Application` class. The `Application` class should have an empty constructor.

Hope it helps! 😸

Just like everything in software engineering, I believe there are tradeoffs to making your code "more OOP". OOP definitely brings a lot of benefits in terms of modularization and flexibility of your code.

However, I do think it does comes at the expense of moving quickly. You will often find yourself going back to old code that is working but needing to refactor them to make it follow OOP. So, it does come with some overhead.

Nevertheless, I believe as software engineers, our job is to be able to discern that and balance what is the right amount of "division" is needed.

Just my opinion! 😸

Perhaps you didn't create a `start` method in `Duke` which overrides the method in the `Application` class you are extending from.

I'm also not sure if this is relevant information, but before this there was another error, which was that gradle compiled the project in Java 21 instead of Java 11, so the app could not run on my friend's system. I did not change my default java version in my environment until now, so after I did that, rebuild, and make using shadowjar again, that issue was resolved, but it now created this issue. 

Maybe me not changing my environment java version until very late might have something to do with this current issue, I'm not sure.

Your `build.gradle` settings should target your `Launcher` class instead of your regular `Duke` class. You can do this by changing the `application` field in `build.gradle` to this:

```java
application {
    mainClass.set("duke.Launcher")
}
``` 

Do also make sure there is only one `application` field in the file because I noticed you specified it twice.

In order to build using Gradle, the project is configured based on your system's version of Java, not the project's. You need to verify that your system is running the correct version of Java too. You can check your system's version of Java using this command:
```shell
java -version
``` 

You should see something like this:
```shell
openjdk version "11.0.20" 2023-07-18 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu11.66+15-CA (build 11.0.20+8-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu11.66+15-CA (build 11.0.20+8-LTS, mixed mode)
```

Check the build version of Java, make sure it includes support for JavaFX. You can refer to the course website for more info. https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/website/admin/programmingLanguages.html

I think for this situation, just add a comment near the change or add documentation near the change, like for gradle, add a comment in the gradle file or even in the Duke file, just signalling that its a dummy commit and you've carried out the increment in a previous commit so you have some proof when it comes to grading. Shouldn't be an issue as pointed out by prof above but if you're apprehensive haha. And add a tag to the dummy commit, so the code gets recorded.

I appreciate the thoughtful discussion on whether to have a separate Storage class in our project. I'd like to share some strengths and advantages of having a dedicated Storage class, despite the tight coupling with TaskList that we've observed:

1. Isolation of Saving/Writing Operations:

One of the key benefits of introducing a Storage class is that it provides a clear separation of concerns. It isolates the task of saving and writing data from the rest of the application logic. This separation makes our codebase more maintainable and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), a fundamental principle in software design.
By encapsulating file I/O operations within the Storage class, we reduce the risk of scattering file-related code throughout the TaskList class. This isolation can help us manage and debug these operations more effectively.

2. Error Handling and Abstraction:

Another advantage of having a Storage class is the opportunity it provides for centralized error handling and abstraction. We can implement error-checking and exception handling in one place within the Storage class, ensuring that any issues related to data storage are handled consistently.
Furthermore, as pointed out by another participant. if we decide to support different data storage formats or locations in the future, the Storage class can serve as an abstraction layer. This allows us to change the underlying storage mechanisms without affecting the TaskList class or other parts of our application. It promotes flexibility and future-proofing.

3. Code Organization and Readability:

From a code organization perspective, having a Storage class can improve the overall readability of our code. It abstracts away low-level file operations and provides a more human-readable interface for saving and loading data. This can make the code within the TaskList class cleaner and easier to understand. 

4. Potential for Future Features:

While our project may not currently have additional data storage needs beyond the TaskList, designing a Storage class can set a foundation for future features. If we ever need to manage other data files alongside the task list, having a dedicated Storage class will make it easier to extend our codebase without introducing unnecessary complexity. Also helps to facilitate reading of same file to multiple task lists and vice versa, helping with versions of files and tasks list.

Personally speaking, I think it would be a better idea to sync to disk every time the user writes something to it. Imagine a scenario where a user accidentally terminates your program, and the expected behavior of your program should memorize everything. Please correct me if I am wrong :)

I understand that when we create unit tests for a particular method, we should isolate the method from its dependencies. However, how about the following case:

```
class Foo {
    public Bar fooMethod() {
        return new Bar();
    }
}
```

Here, it seems that it is impossible to isolate `fooMethod` from the `Bar` class as it is supposed to return it. In such cases, can we assume that it is okay not to isolate the two? If so, then wouldn't `fooMethod` depend on the constructor of `Bar` not being buggy? Apologies if this question seems a little silly 😆

Hi there! I finished creating the test cases required for `A-TextUiTesting` and received the following warning when running `git add` on the `.txt` test case file and `.bat` script file:

`warning: in the working copy of 'text-ui-test/input.txt', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it`

I'm not really sure what this warning means. A search on the internet tells me that it has something to do with something called "Line Feed" and "Carriage Return", but I don't quite understand it. A post on StackOverflow suggested running some git config commands, but I'm worried that something might break. This is the link to the post I read: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1967370/git-replacing-lf-with-crlf

It could be because your code doesn't handle the case where the folder and the file does not exist at the start, since the data folder used when you run runtest.bat is different from the data folder used when you manually test your code. Hope this helps!

You can try running the following commands to rename the tag and update your remote repository

```
git tag [new_tag_name] [old_tag_name]

Perhaps you might want to try gradlew build, then close IntelliJ and reopen it.

Otherwise, I think a brute force way would be to 
Delete the `.gradle` folder in your project and in your users folder (e.g.,: `C:\users\&gt;username>\.gradle`)
Afterwards rebuild gradle using gradlew build
This will force Gradle to download the packages all over again and could solve the problem
However, don't delete the `gradle` folder in the repo.

The creation of 2 jar files is because you specified the `dependsOn("distZip", "distTar")` in the configuration. So when shadowJar is run, it'll execute these tasks resulting in the creation of the additional ip.jar file.

If you dont need the distribution archives, you can remove the `dependsOn("distZip", "distTar")` line from the configuration and it should only generate the `duke.jar` file.

Hi, I was able to publish my website for the iP the first time. My `Ui.png` screenshot even showed in the [iP showcase](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/website/admin/ip-showcase.html). But, the website had some minor formatting issues, so I changed the `README.md` file and committed the changes. But, the website did not reflect the changes. Initially, I thought it was some website cache problem, so I deleted my cache and even tried opening in a different browser, still no changes. Therefore, I tried to force the change by unpublishing the website and trying to republish it. Searching online, I found that to republish the website, I had to go to the repo's `Actions` tab and rerun the `pages-build-deployment` workflow. However, every single time that I did, the deploy failed.

Thing I have tried:

1. Tried to google my problem, but can't seem to find anyone facing this exact problem.
2. Manually re-running the workflow every few minutes.
3. Went to my other github project with a README.md file, tried to setup GitHub pages for that, following similar instructions from CS2103T website, and still got the same deploy failed issue as in the screenshot above.
4. Checked [GitHub status](https://www.githubstatus.com/), everything is normal, including pages.
5. Created an empty commit to trigger a rebuild as stated in a comment from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58358375).

> Try "Level-x" with uppercase "L" instead of lowercase in your tag name?

What I did is:
1. Go to Project Structure in IntelliJ, then download and change the SDK version to 11.
2. Change the java version in your local computer to 11, by following step 2 [here](https://www.happycoders.eu/java/how-to-switch-multiple-java-versions-windows/). Note that the value of the variable JAVA_HOME should be the path to your java version 11 you have downloaded in IntelliJ. For example `C:\Users\Admin\.jdks\corretto-11.0.20.1`.
3. Check java version of your local computer by running `java -version` in terminal to make sure it has been changed to 11.
4. Run the jar file again.

* OS: Mac M2 13.5.1

### Sample Branch with my gradle wrapper :
https://github.com/evanyan13/ip/tree/update-gradle

### Situation
I have been encountering issues when running gradle for the past 5 days and I couldn't seem to figure out what is the issue even after I consulted my team mates. I sincerely hope for your input and advice on resolving this, please.

## Issue 1. Could not find/load main class jarvis.Jarvis when running gradle run
### Error:

I have tried all ways I could find to fix this but I could not seem to get it to work...

### Some actions I have attempted:
1. Revert commit and merge add-gradle-support again
2. Init and rebuild the gradle wrapper file
3. Check my Project structure and whether my main class is set correctly in build.gradle
```
application {
    mainClass.set("jarvis.Jarvis")
}
```

4. Verify my Gradle JVM and Java SDK compatibility

I'm not too sure if this might be because of the same issue with gradle as well so I think I will leave it in the same post for now. I could not run my gradlew file via 
`./gradlew`
as the error above. This is my gradle/wrapper package:

Hi Prof and friends! Great news I finally got my gradle to work after 1 week. 
### So the solution was to move my entire ip to /user instead of /user/Project/

I'm able to get it running from both Intellij and VSCode so I don't think the problem is with the IDE. I'm not very sure why this is the case so I wish to seek advice on this as well, please. Thank you Prof and everyone for your time and attention on my issue.

You currently have your image extensions as .png in MainWindow whereas your resources are in jpg format.
```Java
    private Image userImage = new Image(this.getClass().getResourceAsStream("/images/DaUser.png"));
    private Image dukeImage = new Image(this.getClass().getResourceAsStream("/images/DaDuke.png"));
```
Additionally, after fixing that error you might need to add the FXML annotation to the DialogBox class, as I ran into another error without those tags.

Hi, just a quick question on these two types of variables and how we should declare them in naming. I'm aware that coding standards are just a standard, and they can be changed, just wondering which of the two options we should adhere to or if both are OK.

1. for e.g. a storage class linked to a bot, that is intended to be paired permanently with the bot:
```java
private final Storage ______ = new Storage();
```
what should we put in the space? uppercase STORAGE_FILE (Since it's declared as final) or camelcase storageFile (Since it's mutable)?

2. next, for a variable aggregator such as an arraylist holding multiple objects:
```java
private ArrayList<Task> ______ = new ArrayList<>();
```
I'm aware that the convention recommends a name like listOfTasks; but what if we refer to the arraylist as a single object, like taskHolder or taskList? is that acceptable within the standard of this course?

thanks for the clarification!

Hi guys, update: I found a google style guide [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s5.2.4-constant-names) that states mutable static final objects should **NOT** be written in uppercase, since they don't adhere to what a constant is. Should we adhere to this standard?

I was wondering for the following sections, how should I proceed with the evaluation of the product.

Bugs - 
The description for **below expectations** is `Major bugs. App hardly usable` while the description for **Meets expectations** is `Only minor bugs`
If there is the presence of 2 medium-major bugs (2 commands are straight up unusable - Shows the error message instead of properly performing the command) Should I review as Below or Meets expectations as the current state does not cleanly fit into either of the categories.

Abstraction (methods) - 
The description for **below expectations** is `Very long methods. Deeply nested code` while the description for **Meets expectations** is `No very long methods or deep nesting`.
If there is 1 very long method but the rest of the code mostly has short methods and low levels of nesting should I review it as 'Below expectations' still due to the prescence of the 1 violating method?

On the course website it states that tP v1.1's practice iteration is due by the midnight before the group's tutorial. Is this a specified hard deadline to have v1.1 reached by then?
Because the tutorial for week 7 includes the task of refining the DG after the tutorial.

I was wondering if it would make more sense to leave the PRs for the DG unmerged so that those branches can still be updated (refined) after the tutorial and have v1.1 delivered after the refinement is done (but still before 'Week 8' - before the lecture on Friday)

But this would mean that the v1.1 issues would not be fully solved and the milestone achieved by the midnight before the tutorial session.

hi Jason,
I noticed some changes in the way you wrote your handleInput function. I agree that the splitting of commands into functions would help with structure. 
While the code is much better now, I have a few nits. Given that a majority of code deals with TaskList, perhaps it should be a member variable instead of a function argument?
Overall, good work so far.

I originally installed Java11 using sdkman, but have tried uninstalling and installing from Azul directly but to no avail.

I used the first method to set up JavaFX, but could only load up distributions for MacOs as well.

> Could you try installing a mix of dependencies (keeping the OS distributions for Linux and Windows, but reverting the dependenices for Mac ARM64). I suspect the ARM64 dependency for Mac differs from the general Mac distribution.

I have also tried this set of dependencies, but the project structure came up empty.

Since, I did not implement Checkstyle I am unable to help with your current issues :( 
Thanks a lot! Hopefully we can find a solution to this

Managed to get the jar file running on both windows and macOs by following the build.gradle [above](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/issues/159#issuecomment-1729226821) by @LinWanLeii.

Other than changing the dependencies in build.gradle, I also deleted a line from plugin:
```
    id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.0.13'
```
and the whole of javafx
```
javafx {

Check that in your build.gradle you have

```groovy
application {
    mainClass.set("duke.main.Launcher")
}
```

I'm not entirely sure, but I'm guessing your mainClass is currently set to `duke.main.Main` or `duke.main.Duke` and some code is calling `new Main()` somewhere causing the error you're seeing.

```
As mentioned before, while it is more convenient for one person to update the entire UG, we recommend that each person updates their own part of the docs so that we can easily track the contribution of each member using RepoSense
```
Due to this statement, our team is unsure whether for every part of the project, do we all have to contribute in some way? We are worried that because we did not contribute to a certain aspect, we would get penalised in some way.  For example, for the README page, do we have to contribute a sentence or two? It wouldn't make sense if all 5 members try to participate by contributing a sentence when there's only a few lines. It'll be more efficient if one person does it.

I see thank you! Would it be alright if after everyone contributes their section, there would be one member who would help to clean up and standardise the document? We are wondering if this would affect the grading script as it might potentially create overlapping areas of in our commit history and affect our contribution.

In the [Conventional Commits format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), the subject line would be prefixed with a type, such as `feat` or `fix`, which is in lowercase. This conflicts with the [course's Git conventions](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/git.html), which require the first letter of the subject line to be capitalized.

Are we allowed to use the Conventional Commits format? 

Example: `feat: Add save/load functionality`

In your commit [eb7ee36e19a68ee666531b5ff0a7246361f19ee0](https://github.com/AlainS87/ip/commit/eb7ee36e19a68ee666531b5ff0a7246361f19ee0), I noticed you moved your files out of the `src/main/java/` folder. I think that you should try putting your `alain` package in the `src/main/java/` folder.

The structure should look something like this:
```
ip
├── src
│   └── main
│       └── java
│           └── alain
│               ├── AlainException.java

│               ├── ToDos.java
│               └── Ui.java
```

Then change the `application` field in `build.gradle` to:
```
application {
    mainClass.set("alain.ChatbotAlain")
}

Yep, following what Keagan said with reference to the course website link he provided, perhaps you could try using the Azul jdk 11.0.20 version from [here](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-11-lts&os=macos&architecture=arm-64-bit&package=jdk-fx#zulu) instead of the jdk 11.0.17 version (as configured in your IntelliJ project SDK).

Hi, from my experience, sometimes you need to wait for a while for the codecov page to update. Another thing you can try is to push a commit to your fork (e.g. ammend the README file) and create a pull request. This will prompt codecov to run and if you can see the codecov checks below the build checks like:

Update: Managed to fix the issue. Thank you @dinde2004 for your help.

What I did was:
1. Redownload SDK version 11
2. Overwrite value of environment variable JAVA_HOME to my java version 11 path following step 2 (here)[https://www.happycoders.eu/java/how-to-switch-multiple-java-versions-windows/]
3. Go to project structure and change SDK to 11 and language level to 11
4. Delete .idea and .gradle file
5. Click on Build > Rebuild Project
6. Recreate JAR file using [tutorial link](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/jar.html)

Other issues I encountered during my rebuilding of project:
IntelliJ cannot open Terminal Window
1. Go to IntelliJ and click on Settings > Tools > Terminal
2. Change shell path to: `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`
3. Apply changes and restart IntelliJ

i think you might need to set:
```
application {
    mainClass.set("duke.ui.Launcher")
}
```
instead of 
```
application {
    mainClass.set("duke.Launcher")
}
```
since your Launcher is in the duke.ui package
hope this helps!

I personally think creating two different classes for list of tasks and storage is not necessary. The reason for which is as follows:
1. One cannot exist without the other. TaskList will be stored using Storage and Storage serves only as an intermediary between file storage and TaskList; a task already achieved by `IO::File` class.
2. One cannot operate without the other. TaskList's method is continuously calling Storage's method and Storage's method needs TaskList's data passed to it to operate.
3. Neither is used by other feature. At least as of right now, neither TaskList nor Storage is used by any other class and it is hard for me to see in which scenario this won't be the case.

As such, we've created a scenario where we try to separate two tightly coupled systems to achieve what could be done better (in terms of performance, ease of development, and design) by simply implementing additional methods. In case I missed anything, I would love to hear more reason as to why creating the Storage class is actually necessary. Thank you

Hm I see what you mean, thanks for the response. Elaborating on your case, however, unless we want to impose an implicit rule on how the data is formatted for every kind of data (which we don't), we need to basically create an interface with "save" and "load" method that will be implemented differently for each data format. Then we proceed by creating a `TaskStorage implements Storage` class which will be tightly coupled with our `TaskList` class.

While I understand that this is preferable in projects that have multiple features with other data files, I think creating a `Storage` as a class (and not interface) for our project is rather useless; it doesn't solve the problem you mentioned and at least the first two issues I brought up with this design still persist.

When using String.format(), it is natural to use magic literals. For example: 

`String.format("You used \"%s\" as an argument. A bye command shouldn't have any arguments", desc)`

Is this an acceptable piece of code or is String.format() is not a good method to use?

Ah yes, I believe that using constants on String.format() will really only obscure readability. I suppose the real question we should be asking is: how far is too far when enforcing the no magic literals rule?

You should put Duke.java into duke package but not inside other sub packages.
For me I have: duke.command(Command-related classes), duke.task(Task-related classes, including the various types of tasks), duke.storage(Classes related to file storage), duke.ui( User interface classes), duke(Core classes and exceptions).

The issue arises because the FileWriter essentially truncates the file when it is opened for writing. This means that the contents of the file are erased, and the file becomes empty. As a result, when you subsequently call setup.hasNext() right after creating the FileWriter, it returns false because there are no more tokens to read – the file is empty.

I only invalidated cache, didn't do anything else. Our issues might be slightly different then...

I forgot to push one commit into Github. The code, however, does contain the features that the commit is supposed to have, it is just in another commit. (i.e. one commit has two of the increments for the week A-packages and Gradle). Should I push with the tags but on the A gradle commit, or is any action necessary as the code does have all the features for the IP project?

In addition, if you want to tag a specific commit without a tag that is not the most recent one (and hence renaming is impossible), you can do the following
### Step 1: Find the commit
Run `git log` and use the vim motion keys `j` and `k` to find the specific commit. Copy the commit's hash (the long string of hexadecimal after the word `commit`) and press `q` to quit.
### Step 2: Add the tag
```
git tag [tag_name] [commit_hash]
```
Confusingly, this has the same syntax as renaming the tag as mentioned above.
### Step 3: Update the remote repository
```
git push origin --tags
```

> @LuoZYi You seem to be using [Git sub modules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) in your repo. Specifically, `src/main/java` folder is configured as a sub module (i.e., it resides as a separate repo elsewhere). You need to remove that and replace the folder with the regular files instead. Otherwise not only CI will fail but also our scripts will have no Java code to grade your iP.

Thank you so much prof! I have now successfully set up the page with your suggestion! I realized that previously I set up the project at the wrong path, i.e. at` src/main/java`, and I think all my branches are also at that folder. Thank you so much prof for your help!

It could be because in your duke constructor your calling a method to wait for user response. Hence the programme is stuck waiting for user response and the javafx cant run its method. This is why when u use the bye command the gui appears. Just comment out the part of the constructor where you poll for user response

Hey guys I've been stuck with this error for really long and can't make progress

This is my project structure below. I keep getting constant errors saying that the packages don't exist. I'm very sure I included the package duke / package duke.exceptions declaration at the top of every file. I believe I'm also importing correctly. The javac directory is my source root and I have 3 packages: duke, duke.exceptions and duke.tasks. Would appreciate any help.

I forgot to capitalise the "i" in /Images/DaDuke.png and /images/DaUser.png and the jar file, when run, could not recognise the file path because it is case-sensitive.

I have followed the instructions given on the [website](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html#configuring-checkstyle), added the config files from address book and added the necessary changes to my build.gradle file.

For week 2 iP, I was unclear of the tag naming convention, hence I just did v1.0, v1.1, etc and added the level as comments as shown in the screenshot. Hence, those progress weren't shown in ip tracking dashboard.

How can I change the tag names that are already pushed using either windows terminal or github.

In week 2, it is specified on the website, "From this point onward, commit code at important points. Minimally, commit after completing each increment". Not sure if this will affect grades. Actually, I think we are supposed to separate each increment into different branches. According to your description, it seems like you are implementing it on the master branch only.

- backs up any data previously in `duke.txt` into a separate temporary file
- let my text ui test run without a file / with no existing data

@lunaroddity The reason is because your program is not exiting properly and the scanner is still trying to get input. Try giving the bye command and you will notice that the program does not actually exit. Try using `instanceof` to check for exit condition in your `run` loop:
```java
if (cmd instanceof ByeCommand) {
    isExit = true;
 }
```

Currently facing a similar error, not sure how to solve also. May i ask if you are using a Macbook as well? Seems like the way JavaFx is compiled is with the x86_64, while i'm running on an ARM64 architecture.

A strange thing that occurs on my end however, is that suppose you simply ran gradle clean build, then directly access the shadow jar file using java -jar, it still works fine. Therefore it is only when running using gradle, that was the issue.

It works for me on MacOS. The app opens up a GUI and can save and load from disk. As @Cloud7050 mentioned, the app created the following file path relative to the location of the jar file: "./src/main/java/data/tasks.txt", which I'm not sure if it is intended.

Hi Jason, honestly I think you can consider using regular expression to parse some of your things. As they can be quite flexible in reducing some of the checks that you might need compared to if you are parsing the entire String by itself. Hope this helps.

tested your first code and it works, resulting in an infinite loop. maybe you could provide more details on what you included in your loop, or even your text file. next() and nextline() will progress the scanner, so maybe that's why your hasnext() is becoming false. hope this helps!

Yes, because the Scene builder is v20, once you update the FXML file using Scene builder, the FXML file will use javafx v20. 

I think there are two ways to solve this
1. Use scene builder v17 instead

or

2.  In you fxml files, after you are done with editing using scene builder, manually update the value of the `xmlns` attribute of the 1st XML opening tag.

For example, changing

`&gt;fx:root alignment="TOP_RIGHT" maxHeight="1.7976931348623157E308" prefWidth="400.0" type="javafx.scene.layout.HBox" xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/20" xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1">`

to 

`&gt;fx:root alignment="TOP_RIGHT" maxHeight="1.7976931348623157E308" prefWidth="400.0" type="javafx.scene.layout.HBox" xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx/17" xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml/1">`

in the relevant xml files will make the warning go away. 

Note that if use method 2, you will have to update that everytime you change any files using Scene builder.

Hi @TiwKangXu ,

This is what I have gathered from my experience and from web resources such as StackOverflow based on the information provided in the issue that you have raised.

The error is likely occurring because of a discrepancy in the package name used in the mainClass configuration in your build.gradle file and the actual package name in your code. You may try to go through the following steps to fix the problem:

Update build.gradle:
In your build.gradle file, make sure that you have the correct package name set for the mainClass configuration. Since you mentioned that you changed it to duke.Duke (line 31 in build.gradle), make sure it matches the package name of your Duke.java class.

My file structure is as follows: src > java > main > geraldbot > Duke.java. The following is the way that I have configured my mainClass in build.gradle:

application {
    mainClassName("geraldbot/Duke")
}

Rebuild JAR:
After making sure that the package names are consistent, rebuild the JAR using Gradle to ensure the changes are reflected in the JAR file.  Afterwards, run the jar file to ensure that the JAR is built correctly with the updated package configuration.

After carrying out these steps, open Duke.java in IntelliJ and run it. Since you've updated the package name in both the build.gradle configuration and the source code, you should no longer encounter the LinkageError when running the program within the IDE. Hope this helps.

## Verify your SSH keys

Did you create an SSH keypair on your system? If you didn't, perhaps in week 2 you used the HTTPS URL i.e. https://... instead of the SSH URL to fetch from GitHub, and perhaps you might want to revert to that i.e. `git remote set-url origin &gt;http url>`.

Otherwise, can you check that your SSH keys exist and haven't changed. If you aren't sure where it is and didn't do any special configuration other than googling "how to create SSH key", you can usually find your key-pair at `~/.ssh`.

Run `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and check that there's some output that starts with `ssh-rsa`. **Do not `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa` (notice there's no .pub file extension here) and never send the output from that anywhere.**

## Check your SSH keys on GitHub

Go to the SSH keys configuration page at https://github.com/settings/keys and check that there's at least one SSH key listed there. Ensure that your SSH key output from before (the `id_rsa.pub` file) matches the SSH key listed there. If it doesn't, create a new entry and add the output from before there.

**Again, do not do not do not copy and paste the output from `id_rsa`, copy the output from `id_rsa.pub`.**

As @jiakai-17 has mentioned, you should place your package in the `src/main/java/` folder, Gradle's Java plugin assumes that your code will be in that directory, unless set otherwise.

Make sure you set the correct main class in the build.gradle file. Initially had the same issue, but could be solved by setting the main class as the app entry point which calls the fx dependencies in your code (eg Launcher.java). Hope this helps :)

Changing the type of the text from **Label** to **Text** worked for me.

From some online posts, these two types are different because **Label** is a *Control*, whereas **Text** is a *Shape*. I'm not entirely sure why **Label** will be automatically truncated. My interpretation is that, the properties of a **Label** are binded to its parent and siblings, thus may be affected by other controls in the environment. However the dimensions of a **Text** are fixed once it is created. Maybe someone who can explain more accurately can help chime in here.

**Text** does not have some of the customisable properties of **Label**. I replaced those properties with **wrappingWidth** and **textAlignment** to make sure it looks the same as before.

I faced a similar issue when I tried to distribute my Jar file to a friend using Mac (built on Windows, but unable to run on mac). I believe the issue is with the version of the javafx gradle plugin as brought up by in the Openjfx forum [here](https://github.com/openjfx/javafx-gradle-plugin/issues/112). It seems like the issue with the Gradle plugin was fixed in openjfx version 0.0.13, maybe we could have a hotfix after verifying that is the issue.

For now, I tweaked my build.gradle dependencies to declare the `mac-aarch64` architecture and it was able to run on my friend's mac. You can try this and let us know how it goes!

```

Following the [JavaFx tutorial guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaFxPart1.html), after copying the `start` method into your Duke.java file, 

```java
@Override
    public void start(Stage stage) {

        stage.setScene(scene); // Setting the stage to show our screen
        stage.show(); // Render the stage.
    }

you may encounter the following error when you attempt to run the application:

### Fix 

You will have to create an overloaded constructor that takes in **no** parameters.

>Calling Application.launch(...) causes an instance of your Application subclass to be created, the FX Application toolkit to be started, and start() to be invoked on the created instance.
>
>--<cite>source: [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37634688/cant-run-my-javafx-program-caused-by-java-lang-runtimeexception)


The Application instance is created by calling the no-argument constructor, so the Application subclass, `Duke`, needs to define one:

E.g. if your `Duke` constructor looks something like this:

```java
public Duke(String filePath) {
    // code here
}
```

add an overloaded public constructor that takes in no parameters:

```java
public Duke() {
    this(DEFAULT_FILE_PATH);
}
```

Hope this helps!

Hello prof and friends, When I see GUI I interpret it as a graphical interface in the sense that users can call the commands by interacting with the UI like how we would do with normal applications, which is why I created my program to be something like this (delete, add, mark, unmark, task type) are all selected through a user interface.

<img width="814" alt="image" src="https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2324S1/forum/assets/111076731/538c28df-bde6-486a-a35a-9e5a71b0fda1">


But after looking through the other people's screenshots, I realized GUI would retain the same functionalities (all the commands are accessed through the command line, in this case the user input field), just that we have a graphical representation of it in the form of a chatbot.

Will mine fulfill the requirement or do I need to redo it?

With reference to the image above, it seems that Person has a role "app" containing an object Main, wouldn't this imply that we are able to access that attribute to Main within a Person object. Hence navigate from Person to Main?

I had the same error for my own JAR files, I think you can run java -version on your command terminal to see which version of java you're using, class file version 63.0 would be java 19 if I'm not wrong. You can try manually deleting the other versions of java and leaving only java 11, then make a new JAR file and see if it works.

Not sure if you have found the solution, but I will share my approach to this issue here:

```java
// A simplified section from my code

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions;

public class CommandTest {

    @Test
    public void taskList_inputLessThanOne_exceptionThrown() {
        try {
            Command command = new MarkCommand("0");
            command.execute(taskList, ui, storage);
            Assertions.fail();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            Assertions.assertEquals("The task index cannot be less than 1", e.getMessage());
        }

    }

}
```

Since they are static functions, you can just call them from the Assertions class, e.g. Assertions.assertEquals() instead of assertEquals().
